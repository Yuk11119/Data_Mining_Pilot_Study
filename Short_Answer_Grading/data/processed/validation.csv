8aa679351fd54714a1197455b41fdf7c,What are extension headers in IPv6 and where are they located in a packet? What is the main advantage of extension headers compared to IPv4?,"Extension headers are used to extend the fixed IPv6 header with additional, optional network layer information. If present, they are located between the fixed header/main header and payload/upper-layer header/ transport-layer header. Main advantage: One of the following advantages are considered fully correct: 1. It allows the appending of new options without changing the header. 2. IPv6 packets with optional headers are typically processed faster/simpler by intermediate devices as most of the options are ignored (except “Hop-by-Hop Extension”) while they are processed by all routers in IPv4 unless ordered otherwise.","The extension headers are located between the regular Header and the payload, the extension headers are optional and are only used of needed. The main advantage of having extension headers compared to IPv4 is, that they are optional and can reduce traffic if not needed and that they allow to append new options without having to change a fixed header.",The response is partially correct because the advantage part is somewhat ambiguous.

12e6aeea55ad4924869e5b5f2bc48f30,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","Energy Efficiency: Not having infinite power leads to the problem of having to safe power as to not empty the mobile instantly. Adaption of routing protocols: in a constantly changing network you have to use other routing algorithms, than in a normal network",The response states and describes both the challenges correctly.,Correct,1.0,0

Please describe what information the table holds and how it is modified during the backwards learning phase. How is the table used in the forwarding process and what is one benefit of that? Please answer the question in 2-5 sentences.,"1.A mapping between destinations/stations (MACs) and outgoing LAN interfaces. 2.This table is initially empty and received packages are flooded on every line. When a bridge receives a frame (as the bridge runs in promiscuous mode it listens in on all the traffic arriving at its LAN links) with source address Q on LAN L, it adds the timestamped entry “Q can be reached over L” to the table and the next time a packet with destination Q arrives, it is forwarded on link L. The time-stamp is used to update or purge old entries. Therefore, it learns by observing the incoming traffic. 3.To do selective forwarding instead of flooding. 4.i)less duplication/unnecessary flooding is prevented. ii)less congestion. iii)better bandwidth usage than flooding.","Initially, the bridge table, containing fields for the sender, the receive timestamp and the used LAN, is empty and as a result the bridge will simply use flooding to reach an unknown destination. During the backwards learning phase the bridge works in promiscuous mode - receives all frames from all its LANs - and uses the information of those frames in order to build its table. The information from the table then allows the bridge to forward incoming packets to the correct LAN in order for it to reach its destination. The benefit of this method is that the bridge learns and adapts over time and does not have to rely on flooding, therefore optimizing bandwidth usage.","The response does not state which information is learned from the received packet and how it is used while selectively forwarding packets.

4384e60a7ada4d80984c77b3b3bf6dc0,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","Reverse Path Forwarding and Revers Path Broadcast are used to forward multicast packages without using loops (and therefore not creating duplicates on the way). In Reverse Path Forwarding every node has its own spanning tree. When a package is received by an intermediate station, the station checks if it would send packages to the sender over the used link. If that is the case, then it should be the best route and the intermediate station forwars the package to all connected nodes (except the incoming edge). If it is not the case, then it gets discarded, because it is very likely a duplicate, from another node. Reverse Path Broadcast is an improvement on reverse path forwarding. Instead of forwarding packages to every node (if conditions for forwarding are met) it only forwars it to the node, from where packages would normally arrive from.","The purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse path Broadcast is not limited to the multicast but also used in broadcast. In Reverse Path Forwarding, only the sender needs to know the spanning tree, and it makes use of unicast information to forward the broadcast package.

3cc97149924e40a8b122b8a6f346142c,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","One challenge are ""hidden terminals"". In this case, there are 3 nodes A, B and C and A and C cannot hear each other but A and B and B and C can. So when A sends to B due to the fact that C can't receive A C senses B as ""free"" medium and also sends to B. Then at B a collision occurs which A can't detect. A is therefore ""hidden"" for C and C for A. Another challenge are ""exposed terminals"". There we have 4 nodes A, B, C and D. A can reach B, B can reach A and C, C can reach B and D and D can reach C. Now B sends to A and C wants to send to D. But because C signals a medium in use it has to wait, even if the medium in use is B sending to A and A is outside the radio range of C and the waiting is not necessary. So C is ""exposed"" to B. The third challenge are ""near and far terminals"" which is about 3 terminals A, B and C where A and B are sending and C is receiving. Due to the decrease of the signal strength proportionally to the square of distance the stronger signal (e.g. B's) drowns out the weaker signal (e.g. A's). The result is that C cannot receive A.","In the exposed terminal description, C senses the busy channel rather than signaling it. Apart from that, the answer is correct.",Correct,1.0,0

Does this assumption hold for real INTERNET traffic? Explain your answer in 2-5 sentences.","No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.","No the assumptions does not hold, since the arrivals depend on each other. For example one request to a server leads to multiple packets being sent back. Also the answer of the server then might lead to multiple requests afterwards. Thus the packets come in stacks with time in between, since the server and the client need to process the packets.",The response is correct except that it attributes the bursty nature of the internet traffic to the request/response model which is not always the case.,Partially correct,0.75,0

The data is send immediately on the contrary to the connection-oriented service. In unconfirmed conn. less service, you have to expect that the sent packet arrives but you have no feedback Acknowledge-signal (ACK) whether the packet arrived. For confirmed conn. less service, when data is send via data request and arrived (data indication), the receiver answers to the sender by an acknowledgement (ACK) , so there is a feedback signal stating that data arrived successfully. So far (for unconfirmed and confirmed connection less service), data is send and acknowledged (for confirmed conn. less) immediately. There is no difference for connection, data or disconnection phases. By using connection-oriented service, you have requests and indications for connection establishment, data transfer and the disconnection.

EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.,"Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)","Spanning trees are appealing to broad- and multicasting scenarios, because they allow the packets to only travel one path (except travling backwards). This removes the need for looking up specific tables as in RPF / RPB.",It is true that there is a unique path between nodes but that not only does away with the need to look at routing tables in RPF/RPB but reduces duplicates by removing loops(unnecessary links).

7db19e90e7ee46eb9fdb83d2014cc8a5,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","Network Topology and Access Points- Network topology and Access Points changes faster when the devices are moving around which is not the case in fixed network. Security - As the network could be available even inside and outside the building, it possesses a threat to security.

b2ee36747d6c48d3985a600ef492f1f5,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","The challenges are: * Security:the packet of data is not much secure.Through neighbor authentication, a user can know it neighboring users.For security of packet we must have to use technique of data encryption. * QoS * Scalability * Heterogeneity * Adaptation:Network has to adapt to Dynamic positioning of nodes.This is necessary and nodes may join the network or may leave the network dynamically. * Dependability -","The response names 5 requirements but describes only two.

When a bridge receives a frame (as the bridge runs in promiscuous mode it listens in on all the traffic arriving at its LAN links) with source address Q on LAN L, it adds the timestamped entry “Q can be reached over L” to the table and the next time a packet with destination Q arrives, it is forwarded on link L. The time-stamp is used to update or purge old entries. Therefore, it learns by observing the incoming traffic. 3.To do selective forwarding instead of flooding. 4.i)less duplication/unnecessary flooding is prevented. ii)less congestion. iii)better bandwidth usage than flooding.","Each entry in the bridge table holds: a destination address S, which LAN (link) L is to be used to reach S, and a timestamp T of when last the frame from S arrived. With backward learning, the bridge learns from an incoming frame and the LAN connected to the link through which the frame was received that the frame's source S can be reached via LAN L (directly or through other bridges) and stores/updates this information (S, L and frame arrival time T) on any arrival of a frame with S as the source address (and purge it by another process if it is too old, that's why T is stored). The forwarding process uses the bridge table by looking up the entry for a given destination address S to decide what to do with an incoming frame addressed for S: if an entry is found then the frame is either rerouted via the destination link L if that link is different from the incoming link or discarded (as it should not leave the LAN), else flooding is used as a fallback (destination LAN unknown).

EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.,"Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",All intermediate stations periodically have to send link state packets via broadcast to all others.

When a bridge receives a frame (as the bridge runs in promiscuous mode it listens in on all the traffic arriving at its LAN links) with source address Q on LAN L, it adds the timestamped entry “Q can be reached over L” to the table and the next time a packet with destination Q arrives, it is forwarded on link L. The time-stamp is used to update or purge old entries. Therefore, it learns by observing the incoming traffic. 3.To do selective forwarding instead of flooding. 4.i)less duplication/unnecessary flooding is prevented. ii)less congestion. iii)better bandwidth usage than flooding.","The table holds the information to what LAN/other bridge a package should be send to in order to reach its destination.

This makes the Bridge self sufficient and other components of the network does not need to know about the bridge. Whenever a frame is received the Bridge knows that the source can be reached over the incoming LAN and creates a table entry or updates its table accordingly.

d641379a69a34431b09b2b668efc9219,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast are both broadcast algorithms that attempt to minimize the number of duplicates packets in the network compared to other algorithms like the simple Flooding algorithm. The idea of Reverse Path Forwarding is that each sender/node has an own spanning tree, but the other ISs do not need to know them. The algorithm is based on a simple condition for each node. The node has to decide, whether the received packet sent over the best route, i.e. it used the edge the node would use to send it back to the sender/author or not. If this is true, the node resends this packet over all other edges, i.e. excluding the incoming one, otherwise, the packet is most likely a duplicate and it will be discarded. The Reverse Path Broadcast goes a little further and the IS sends the packet from the best route only to the nodes it is responsible for/the sender used before. If the IS is on the best path between the sender and his neighbor node, i.e. it is responsible for it, it learns over time.",The response correctly explains RPF and RPB and their purpose.,Correct,1.0,0
9c41490c7ccf47bfb7914755eb5a05e4,"To model the packet arrivals as a poisson process, we assumed that the arrivals for each time interval Δt are independent. Does this assumption hold for real INTERNET traffic? Explain your answer in 2-5 sentences.","No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.","This assumption is not realistic for real internet traffic. It is different between day and night. For example in video traffic, a window buffer may be on to fetch the next segments of video, then off to deplete it, and then on again to fetch the next further segments of video.","One can use a function instead of a constant to model the arrival rate to reflect such large-scale, day-night behavioral patterns.

26a002ad89bc42d2abcf9bcb604424f5,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",Purpose of RPF and RPB: Avoid receiving duplicate packets * RPF: Use unicast routing information to decide if an incoming packet is dropped or sent further via the outgoing links: * send further if incoming packet used path in unicast routing info * drop if incoming packet did not use path in unicast routing info * RPB: Select outgoing edges: * Select edge if a packet coming from the connected node to the sender would use this edge. * Sent incoming packet via selected edges (not including the incoming edge).,The response correctly answers the purpose and the explanation for both broadcast types. The purpose is to avoid forwarding duplicate packets not receiving but it is acceptable.,Correct,1.0,0

Due to the use of slot reservation, this MAC can also provide good service in an expending network. TDMA needs synchronized clocks on all systems for the time slots to work. Even though the reservation window is contention based possibly leading to collisions, this section makes up only a small fraction of the transmission process. However, if in the reservation phase to much collisions happen, the slots will stay unused meaning a low utilization. In this case a p-persistent CSMA (/CD) would be a better fit, while p depends on the current load and number of stations and whether Collision Detection should be used, depends on the cable length. Reasons against the other protocols: Polling would need a centralized controller. TDMA without reservation possibly wastes slots for systems, that don't have anything to transmit, and isn't as flexible to an increasing network size. A token ring is expensive and only provides low throughput. ALOHA in both forms doesn't provide good throughput in a high load network, since many collisions will happen.

c6b126b160dd48c88c07c97e3860b222,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","In mobile communication, nodes can move, i.e. are not placed on a fixed location, and are transmitting over the air, i.e. they use wireless communication. This stands in big contrast to fixed and wired networks. To adapt to these new factors, challenges on many different layers occur. Whether the Discovery of Service in the Application Layer, the specific needs for routing in the Network Layer, or the control of power used for transmission in the Physical Layer and even more have to be taken into account to set up such a mobile network. - For mobile routing, the following challenges exist: o Hosts can move and change the attachment to a certain network segment (handover). This handover mechanisms occur in cellular networks and in complex WLAN infrastructures as well. For the example of WLAN, handover can be handled at the link layer if both ace points are in the same networks. If there are different networks, a network layer handoff occurs and needs to be considered to implement routing for a seamless service. o In mobile ad-hoc networks, nodes can disappear due to the radio system and channel characteristics. Therefore the network topology may change rapidly and pre-calculated, pro-active routing may fail. In this case, reactive routing maybe of preference, as the route is calculated using the actual network topology. - Moreover, the general challenges in mobile communication include: o Hidden terminals § Since in mobile communication no wire is used, the nodes can only listen for a certain distance defined by the radio parameters and the channel characteristics, which makes the usage of CSMA/CD not practicable as the concept of Carrier Detection (CD) does not work. An already happening transmission to a certain destination node could not be detected by an intermediate system (IS) if the node communicating with the destination node is out of the “listening”-range of the IS. To solve this problem the collision will not be “detected” but “avoided” using certain ACKs (CSMA/CA, RTS/CTS). o Exposed terminals § When a node wants to send a packet and detects an already existing transmission in its transmission area, it waits until the existing transmission is finished and only thereafter sends its packet to avoid collisions. This can cause underutilization of a channel if the receiving nodes are far enough away from each other, i.e. beyond the radio range, and therefore both transmissions would not affect each other and could have successfully be completed in parallel. o Near and Far terminals § If multiple packets arrive at the receiver, they will typically arrive with different signal strengths. Depending on the modulation used, the receiver will detect the “stronger” packet and ignore the “weaker” packets if the power difference is large enough. However, fading and multipath may lead to changing power levels and add complexity to the problem. § Using a multipath receiver design, both packets can be detected as different paths and the receiver may fail to detect these packets. The near/far problem is difficult to solve in direct sequence spread spectrum systems (rake receivers). In OFDM based system, this problem is less severe.",The response correctly states the challenges faced in the wireless network.,Correct,1.0,0

Similarly to Manchester encoding, DM encoding takes advantage of splitting the interval into two, where a voltage level shift takes place (either from high voltage to low voltage or vice versa). However, Manchester encoding is still too similar to binary encoding in that a 1 will always be equivalent to a voltage shift from high --> low and a 0 will always be low --> high voltage. Instead, if the voltage shift occurs between intervals (either high -> low or low -> high), a 0 will be encoded. Likewise, if there is no voltage shift between intervals then a 1 is encoded. By comparing the current interval to the previous interval's voltage level, a more accurate encoding technique can be realized. And unlike the binary encoding system, DM encoding does not rely on binary voltage levels to encode a bit stream. Instead, merely a change in voltage level between intervals encodes the bit stream. (Ex. A lack of voltage level change between the first and second interval would mean that the second bit in the stream is a 1) Therefore, because the voltages only need to differ between intervals, the bit stream is less susceptible to noise/error.",The preference is always for a simple solution.

451bd0e0ee4942cfb9de5158be4fa341,"To model the packet arrivals as a poisson process, we assumed that the arrivals for each time interval Δt are independent. Does this assumption hold for real INTERNET traffic? Explain your answer in 2-5 sentences.","No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.","After all, this is not less and not more than a simple model. The details of internet traffic including bursty traffic situations, streams like video (e.g. YouTube, Netflix) or audio (e.g. internet telephony) or the traffic depending on daytime or season cannot be modelled accurately using a Poisson process. There is some derivatives of the Poisson process to better model the bustiness, e.g. the compound Poisson process. However, the Poisson process has some nice mathematical features allowing a simpler math and therefore allowing to analytically describe queueing systems. Therefore it is widely used for a first analysis or for more mathematical modelling. If a system needs to be analyzed in more detail, simulations tools (e.g. Opnet) can be used. This does not lead to a mathematical formula but delivers more precise numerical results and enables the modelling of a wide variety of data source models.","The question asks whether it is true that the arrivals at a node depend on previous arrivals for real internet traffic instead of whether the Poisson process is a realistic model. The reasoning is correct for both questions, but the definitive answer to arrival independence is missing.",Partially correct,0.5,0

When cwnd >= ss_thresh, the congestion avoidance phase is entered. After a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. Then cwnd is reset to 1. Congestion Avoidance (cwnd >= ss_thresh):: In the congestion avoidance phase, cwnd is incremented more slowly. There are different incrementation strategies, but they usually grow linearly, e.g. only increment cwnd by 1 after all sent segments have been acknowledged. This is done until a packet is lost.

Assume you monitor the system for exactly one minute after the system reaches equilibrium. How many seconds would you expect the system to be in a state in which there are less than 10 packets waiting in the queue? You need to justify your answer by showing steps involved; calculations, however, need not be included. headers.","Since we have a buffer size (N) of 10, we will always have less than 10 packets waiting in the queue unless there are exactly 10 packets in the queue. Therefore, we first calculate the probability of the system being full/having 10 packets in the queue. This is also called “blocking probability” or P_B. P_B = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^N) / 1 - utilization^(N+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508 Alternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate P(X less than 10) = (1 -P_B) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, …, 9 packets to be in the queue. To calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with P(X less than 10) or the complement of P_B (0.25p) = 60 * (1-P_B) = 56.9512 seconds","The given example is a finite buffer case, so a M/M/1/10 Queue. With the given numbers, the utilization rate is 9/10 = 0,9. So if on an average 9 packets arrive and 10 can be served, there should never be 10 packets waiting in the queue. However, by calculating the blocking probability (the probability that the system is full) with the given formula, Pb = 0,0508 which is ca. 5%. So there is a 5% probability, that the system is full and 10 packets are waiting in the queue. For 1 minute (60 seconds) 5% are 3 seconds. If I say that the system is in a state with 10 packets waiting in the queue for 3 seconds, I would expect the system to be in a state with less than 10 packets waiting for 57 seconds. If I take a look at the system throughput and insert the values in the formula, the result is 8,5428‬.

If 9 packets arrive per second, 27,432/9 = 3,048 seconds in which the system is full.

This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","ONE CHALLENGE IS THE USER MOBILITY. IN CONTRAST TO FIXED AND WIRED NETWORKS, USERS CAN MOVE AROUND WHILE COMMUNICATING WIRELESSLY ANYTIME, ANYWHERE AND WITH ANYONE. THIS BRINGS ADDITIONAL COMPLEXITY TO ROUTING MECHANISMS SINCE THEY HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT OPTIMAL PATHS MAY CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME AND HAVE TO BE RECALCULATED. Another challenge is the device portability which is a requirement for the ability of devices to connect anytime and anywhere to the network. Properties like power consumption or space play a more significant role when compared to fixed and wired networks.","The response is partially correct because portability is not a challenge itself. However, the description mentions the power consumption of mobile devices which is an important challenge in mobile routing.",Partially correct,0.75,0

There are different incrementation strategies, but they usually grow linearly, e.g. only increment cwnd by 1 after all sent segments have been acknowledged. This is done until a packet is lost. Typically, this means that cwnd less than ss_thresh and the slow start phase is entered again. After a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. Then cwnd is reset to 1.","At the beginning (during phase 1, also called slow start), the Congestion Window (cwnd) is set to one and duplicates with each cycle until ss_thresh is reached. Once cwnd >= ss_thresh, phase 2 starts, also called congestion avoidance. Here, cwnd is only incremented by one until a congestion occurs. Then, the process starts again with ss_thresh = cwnd/2 and cwnd=1.","The response is partially correct because it is unclear what is meant by the cwnd duplicating every ""cycle"" in the slow start phase.

HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms.

Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","The purpose is to reduce packet duplicates due to flooding. * REVERSE PATH FORWARDING: The receiving router checks, if the incoming packet used the usual (proboably best) path to it. If it is the case, the packet will be forwarded to all links except the one at which the packet arrived. If a packet arrives at an unusual path (probably not the best path and a duplicate), the incoming packet will be ignored (discarded) and not forwarded any farther. * REVERSE PATH BROADCAST: Similiar to _Reverse Path Forwarding except _that a node gains information about the best paths between neighbouring nodes due to observation. That is, a packet will not be forwarded via every link but only via those links, which are unlikely to create more duplicates.

38475cc21db4449482e03d397d3782d5,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","Hidden Terminal: If multiple nodes are hidden from each other, the transmission to a common node of them results in a collision at the common receiver. Two nodes are hidden from each other, when they cannot sense each other (distance > detection range). Near and Far Terminals: Stronger signals drown weaker signals. That means that the distance of the nodes can influence the communication behavior because the signal strength depends on the distance to the sender.",The response correctly states and describes the hidden terminal problem.

Advantage :it is more efficient than carrier extension as single frames not filled up with garbage. Disadvantage :need frames waiting for transmission or buffering and delay of frames","Frame bursting enables the sender to transmit concentrated sequence of multiple spaces in a single transmission. Therefore a buffer waits for a set of packets to send them all once together. An advantage of frame bursting is the high efficiency due to the amount of data that can be sent in one transmission. In the carrier extension only 9% user data is possible to send which leads to a low efficiency. A disadvantage of frame bursting is the long time it takes to be transmitted. If you just want to send two packets you have to put some additional data or rubbish inside because the frame only will send if the whole frame is filled with data. The higher latency is introduced through the packing/filling of the buffer, depending on the implementation, either the two packages get stuck or transmitted with a higher latency with rubbish frames to fill the buffer. This causes a delay. Therefore the carrier extension is better to send less packages and does not lead to a delay.","The response answers all three parts of the question correctly.

Does this assumption hold for real INTERNET traffic? Explain your answer in 2-5 sentences.","No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.","This assumption mostly does not hold for real internet traffic as packets are not sent independently and in a steady way. Rather, internet traffic is very bursty. Data and messages are not sent via individual and independent packets so a single packet most likely is part of a larger message with which it is sent together.","It is correct that the assumption does not hold because of bursty traffic.

eab91bf79f2640e3ad08ed9fadbc11b0,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","There are a multitude of challenges facing mobile routing. From the speed the mobile hosts have, to security, scalability etc. Two challenges of mobile routing are hidden terminals and exposed terminals. Hidden Terminals: The hidden terminal problem occurs when multiple nodes can access one IS, but not each other. This leads to issues when both nodes try to send data packets to the IS in the middle simulatenously. As the nodes that are not in each others reach are ""hidden"" from each other, they cannot detect the collision at the IS in the middle. Exposed Terminals: The exposed terminal problem occurs when multiple nodes are in close vicinity and in their neighboring radio range. A node (lets call it B) has to wait for an adjacent one (C) to finish with their data transmission (to a node D) before starting their own, even if their destination node (lets call it A) would be a node that is not in the radio range of C. The sender node that has to wait (B) is ""exposed"" to the traffic from the IS next to it (C). This leads to underutilization of the channel and low efficiency.",The response correctly states and describes the hidden and exposed terminal problems in wireless networks.,Correct,1.0,0

f898735b8bf444c3b10f97085cdd2c7e,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","Reverse path forwarding (RPF) and reverse path broadcast (RPB) are techniques used in routers. They enable loop-free forwarding of multicast packets in multicast routing. REVERSE PATH FORWARDING: In this procedure, each node i checks whether an incoming packet from source q has been received on the connection on which node i also transmits its packets to q. If this is the case, then the packet is assumed to have been transmitted on the shortest route and it is forwarded on all other lines. If, on the other hand, a packet was received on a line other than the one on which data is transmitted to the sender, then it is assumed that it is a duplicate that did not take the shortest route. This duplicate is then discarded instead of being forwarded. REVERSE PATH BROADCAST: RPB is an improvement on RPF. RPB not only evaluates the shortest path with respect to the interface where the multicast packets are received, but also influences the forwarding of data to the interface of the router. As a result, multicast packets are only forwarded to the interfaces where the next router is located in the reverse direction on the shortest path to the data source. RPB specifically checks whether the incoming packet arrives at the IS through which the packets for this station/source are normally also sent. If not, the packet is discarded directly. If yes, it will be further checked if the packet has taken the best path so far. If yes → select the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source S (in reversed direction) If not → do not send over all edges (without the incoming one)",The purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse path Broadcast is not limited to the multicast but also used in broadcast. The explanation of RPF and RPB is correct.,Correct,1.0,0

To calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with P(X less than 10) or the complement of P_B (0.25p) = 60 * (1-P_B) = 56.9512 seconds","From the problem we recognise that the number of packets arriving is lambda=9 pkts per second and number of packets being serviced is µ=10 pkts per second. Dividing the lambda by µ gives us the utilization. In the case of an equilibrium in a finite buffer, the probability of having less than 10 packets can be calculated from the formula of the blocking probability (slide 31). As this formula would give us the probability of the system being full, we would then need to subtract it from 1.

06534fe07bfc4a6f815324c6cc291e6c,"Consider a single server queueing system with a buffer of size 10. Let us assume that 9 packets arrive per second and 10 packets are served per second on an average. Assume you monitor the system for exactly one minute after the system reaches equilibrium. How many seconds would you expect the system to be in a state in which there are less than 10 packets waiting in the queue? You need to justify your answer by showing steps involved; calculations, however, need not be included. headers.","Since we have a buffer size (N) of 10, we will always have less than 10 packets waiting in the queue unless there are exactly 10 packets in the queue. Therefore, we first calculate the probability of the system being full/having 10 packets in the queue. This is also called “blocking probability” or P_B. P_B = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^N) / 1 - utilization^(N+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508 Alternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate P(X less than 10) = (1 -P_B) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, …, 9 packets to be in the queue. To calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with P(X less than 10) or the complement of P_B (0.25p) = 60 * (1-P_B) = 56.9512 seconds","57s The average arrival rate is 9 and the average service rate is 10. According to the limited buffer size 10 we can calculate PB, which means the probability that the system is full. So the probability that in the state there are less than 10 packets is 1-PB. Based on the 1 minute monitoring time we can get the result 57s",The response correctly states the non-blocking time and provides a valid justification for the calculation.,Correct,1.0,0

c865fb83194f4482a2a382e968409992,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","Reverse Path Forwarding : purpose:Variation of the Spanning Tree,Each sender has its own Spanning Tree,but IS do not need to know the Spanning Trees Algorithm:Has this packet arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent? Yes: -Assumption: Packet used the BEST route until now Action: resend over all edges (not including the incoming one) No: -Assumption: Packet did NOT use this route (it is NOT the best route) Action: discard packet (most likely duplicate) Reverse Path Broadcast: purpose:Has packet arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent? Yes: -Packet used the BEST route until now -resend over ALL edges(not including the incoming one) No: Discard Packet did NOT use this route (it is NOT the best route) Algorithm: packet from S(ource) to D(estination) Like REVERSE PATH FORWARDING with specific selection of the outgoing links Has this packet arrived at THE IS entry over which the packets for this station/source S are usually also sent? YES: Packet used the BEST route until now? YES: select the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source S (in reversed direction) NO: DO NOT send over all edges (without the incoming one), i.e., not as in Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) NO: discard packet",The response correctly explains  RPF and RPB but the stated purpose is incorrect. It should be to reduce the number of duplicates and unnecessary packets in flooding/broadcasting by inspecting the optimal unicast paths.,Partially correct,0.8,0

Instead a 3 phased communication with connect and disconnect, and flow control","Unconfirmed connection-less service, confirmed connection-less service, and connection-oriented service. An unconfirmed connection-less service offers no feedback, if the sent frame was received. A confirmed connection-less service offers this feedback with a simple acknowledgment per frame, therefore no loss occurs. But the acknowledgment can also lead to duplicates because the sender may have not received the ACK yet and retransmits the frame. In contrast to other two, a connection-oriented service provides a connection without duplication or sequencing errors and provides flow control, because the connection is setup (exchange of parameters, i.e. sequence number) and teared down afterwards.",The response answers the services' names and differences correctly.,Correct,1.0,0
18ca0dbe65a74c01909594c4fc73ba16,"Consider the following network topology from the lecture:With routing, we want to find the best path for our packets. For this, we first need to define a metric to evaluate the quality of a path. One possible choice could be the current load (i.e. the current utilization in terms of sent packets/bytes) on this path. Assume that A wants to send data to G, could this routing strategy cause any problems at the receiver end? Please explain your answer in 1-2 sentences.","Yes, using the current load to find the best path can lead to fluctuations/oscillations when there is more than one path between any pair of end systems in the network (here: CF and EI). This can cause packet reorderings at the receiving side.","This strategy could cause problems: The routing algorithm would constantly alternate between using link CF or EI, because when one of them is part of the current route, the other one seems like the better choice because it has lower utilization. So even if using only one of the links exclusively would make more sense because it may have higher bandwidth than the other one, this strategy would alternate between them.",But why is alternating a problem?,Partially correct,0.75,0
