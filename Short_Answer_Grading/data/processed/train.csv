76a8b716eb8f4bdf8ef918aa1ab467ad,"Consider a single server queueing system with a buffer of size 10. Let us assume that 9 packets arrive per second and 10 packets are served per second on an average. Assume you monitor the system for exactly one minute after the system reaches equilibrium. How many seconds would you expect the system to be in a state in which there are less than 10 packets waiting in the queue? You need to justify your answer by showing steps involved; calculations, however, need not be included. headers.","Since we have a buffer size (N) of 10, we will always have less than 10 packets waiting in the queue unless there are exactly 10 packets in the queue. Therefore, we first calculate the probability of the system being full/having 10 packets in the queue. This is also called “blocking probability” or P_B. P_B = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^N) / 1 - utilization^(N+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508 Alternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate P(X less than 10) = (1 -P_B) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, …, 9 packets to be in the queue. To calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with P(X less than 10) or the complement of P_B (0.25p) = 60 * (1-P_B) = 56.9512 seconds","This can be calculated by using the blocking probability which is the probability for that the system is full (slide 31 in script).

99a2b05b1e8c42f09feeae71be973b31,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","The purpose of these two algorithms is to broadcast the packets to all the nodes present while reducing the duplicates. Reverse Path Forwarding: When a packet is received at an IS from a sender, then it is checked whether this is the correct and shortest path followed or not ie if the IS had to send the packets back will it use the same route or not. If the route is correct, in that case the packet is accepted and then forwarded to all other edges. If not then then packet is discarded as it might be a duplicate packet. Reverse Path Broadcast: When a packet is unicasted to a particular station the other other station listen to check if that is the best route to the packet forwarding for the receiver station or not. If that is the best route then when a packet arrives at a station then it is also send to this edge. If that is not the best route then the packet is rejected and not sent on that path. In this case it learns from the packets whether a node lies in the path of sending or receiving to a particular node or not if it does then it also forwards the packet to that path else it does not forward to that path.","The response correctly answers the purpose and the explanation for both broadcast types.In both algorithms, the packet is also not forwarded to the edge from which it was received.",Partially correct,0.9,0

c797b1d4d1c4440283bbc5057e97fb6d,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","-Hidden Terminals: Suppose nodes A and C can’t hear each other and B can hear A and C. When A sends to B, but C wants to send to B, at this time, a collision is occurred at B. -Exposed Terminals:Suppose node B can hear A and C, C can hear B and D, A can’t hear D. B sends to A, at the same time C wants to send to another terminal like D. But C has to wait, because B says that the channel is in use.

Assume you monitor the system for exactly one minute after the system reaches equilibrium. How many seconds would you expect the system to be in a state in which there are less than 10 packets waiting in the queue? You need to justify your answer by showing steps involved; calculations, however, need not be included. headers.","Since we have a buffer size (N) of 10, we will always have less than 10 packets waiting in the queue unless there are exactly 10 packets in the queue. Therefore, we first calculate the probability of the system being full/having 10 packets in the queue. This is also called “blocking probability” or P_B. P_B = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^N) / 1 - utilization^(N+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508 Alternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate P(X less than 10) = (1 -P_B) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, …, 9 packets to be in the queue. To calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with P(X less than 10) or the complement of P_B (0.25p) = 60 * (1-P_B) = 56.9512 seconds","First of all we can derive all necessary values from the text: The buffer size is N=10, the arrival rate is ƛ = 9 and the service rate is μ = 10. As a next step, we can then calculate the change rate of the queue to ρ = ƛ/μ = 0.9. What we have to do next is to calculate the state probability for all states with less than 10 packets in the queue and sum those values up. We use the formula p_n = ((1-ρ)ρ^n)/(1-ρ^(N+1)) for each single state. The state probability for all states with less than 10 waiting packets can be calculated as the following term: P(waiting packets less than 10) = p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 + p_6 + p_7 + p_8 + p_9 = 0.9492. In the last step, we have to combine this finding with the time of observation. Multiplying those values delivers us the expected length of a state with less than 10 packets in the queue: E(T | waiting packets less than 10) = 0.9492 * 60s = 56.952s.

EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.,"Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)","The properties of Spanning Tree is Subset of subset including all router with no loop and to provide link redundancy while simultaneously preventing undesirable loops Prevent Broadcast Storms Maintain the overall load at a low level To modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting, all IS send link state packets periodically by broadcast to all the others containing information like distance to neighbors, expanded by information on multicast groups.

869933e0136d4202bd19a6493bfecea4,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast prevent loops in networks. Every router knows all routes to the other nodes but blocks all of them besides the shortest. If a packet now arrives at an intermediate system, it will be checked if the packet has used the shortest path so far by comparing the incoming direction with the usual direction packets with the same sender come from. In case it is the same direction it will be forwarded over every other edge besides the one where it has arrived. If it has arrived from another direction the packet will be discarded since it is most likely a duplicate. Reverse Path Broadcast uses Reverse Path Forwarding in an algorithm to send a packet to everyone with less duplicates than flooding.","The purpose of both is to avoid forwarding of broadcast packets in loops/ duplicates like stated in the RPB explanation, not prevent loops in networks as stated in the first sentence. The description of the RPB algorithm is incorrect. RPB works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree.

a7b0a317fe534c63abaa76d46b851abd,WHICH PROPERTY of spanning trees makes them appealing for broad- and multicasting? EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.,"Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",Spanning trees allows to reach all other nodes of a network with a small subset of links. This is favorable for broadcasting and multicasting because it limits the number of packet-copies and prevents loops. Each IS broadcasts it’s local link state info periodically to all other IS. The info is distributed in packets and contains the distance to the neighbors as well as the info on multicast groups (each IS knows to which group it belongs to)! Then each IS has all the link state info and calculates the multicast tree.,The response correctly identifies the spanning-tree property that makes it appealing for broadcast and multicast and how the link-state algorithm is modified to construct a  multicast spanning tree.,Correct,1.0,0

When cwnd >= ss_thresh, the congestion avoidance phase is entered. After a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. Then cwnd is reset to 1. Congestion Avoidance (cwnd >= ss_thresh):: In the congestion avoidance phase, cwnd is incremented more slowly. There are different incrementation strategies, but they usually grow linearly, e.g. only increment cwnd by 1 after all sent segments have been acknowledged. This is done until a packet is lost.

Does this assumption hold for real INTERNET traffic? Explain your answer in 2-5 sentences.","No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts.

d0225bac86f440c9bf858012a4c5023a,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast are routing algorithms that are used for multicast routing scenarios. To adjust to changing topologies they utilize flooding to find suitable routes. The principle of the Reverse Path Forwarding is that each station has a spanning tree that represents the routing to other stations. The packets are flooded from the first sending station and propagated through the network. When a packet is received, each station checks whether a packet arrived at the port it usually arrives at. If so it is assumed that it used the best path until now and the packet is sent to the other adjacent stations, otherwise it is discarded. The Reverse Path Broadcast follows a similar approach. It differs in how it handles packets that are received on the entry port packets to this destination are usually assumed at. There is an additional check, if the packet used the best route until now. If so the edge is selected at which unicast packets arrive and from which they are then rerouted to the source. Otherwise it is not sent over all edges.","The response incorrectly states the purpose. The purpose of RPF and RPB is to reduce redundant packets/duplicates when broadcasting instead of just adapting to changing topology. The explanation of RPF is partially correct as each station(say X) checks if the packets arrived at a port that is used in unicast for sending a packet from X to S.

EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.,"Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)","Spanning trees avoid loops in the subnets which make them pretty useful for multicast, as the spanning tree already mitigates any loops in the multicast forwarding. To work with Link State Routing, the link state packets have to be broadcasted to all other nodes to be able to calculate a spanning tree on each node separately. The distance information are updated periodically with the distances to the neighbors by the other IS.","The response correctly answers why a spanning-tree usage is ideal in multicast, but the same reasoning also holds for broadcast.

Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",Hidden terminals: Communication signals can collide with signals of an intermediate node without the two senders noticing - connection is more unreliable than in fixed networks * Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength is dependent of the terminals position - wired connection are more equally weighted.

Initially, the bridge table is basically empty (as it knows nothing before about the networks connect to it), flooding is used to get to know any of the output line coming to it. Then during the backward learning phase, bridge works in promiscuous mode as it receives any frame on any of its connected LANs and creates one table entry for every reachable station over its corresponding connected LAN. These entries used to forward incoming frames to the specifically known and reachable destination without having to always blindly flooding all the data to every possible station. Each entry is inserted with a specific timestamp, which is the arrival time of the frame. With these timestamps for every entry of the table, the table is dynamically updated by being periodically scanned for changes and remove old and outdated entries. For a long enough period of time without any either updates or changes (normally a few minutes). Flooding is started again as it is going to refresh the whole table.

Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","1. Hidden Terminals Every node has its transmission range. In hidden terminals problem, there are three nodes A, B and C. Nodes A and C cannot hear each other due to the limited range. When they both want to transmit packages to B, the tranmissions can collide at node B. In this case, nodes A and C are hidden from each other, which could cause more collisions in the channel. 2. Exposed Terminals There are now four nodes A, B, C and D. B sends to A and C wants to send to D, which will not receive anything from A. But C has to wait, because it signals that a medium is in use.

31ddeba716cf45e69f4fc5b478ab815c,WHICH PROPERTY of spanning trees makes them appealing for broad- and multicasting? EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.,"Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)","With spanning trees you are able to gain global knowledge of the multicast groups from an initial local knowledge, which makes the spanning trees appealing. In order to modify the Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting you can use the normal procedure of the Link State Routing but also add the information on the multicast groups. With that each IS calculates its own multicast trees with the locally available information. Then based on the information about the multicast tree it determines which paths to use for transmitting packets.","Yes, global knowledge can be obtained from local knowledge, but that is the description of constructing spanning trees with link-state, not a desirable property of spanning trees. It is desirable for use in multicast and broadcast because of the absence of loops which reduces unnecessary duplicates.  The explanation for modifying the link-state algorithm to construct a  multicast spanning tree for nodes is correct.",Partially correct,0.5,0

259265f2f48d4b3cb6c39b6ff88285a8,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","The purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) and Reverse Path Broadcast (RPB) is to guarantee the most efficient way to forward information from any sender to any receiver terminal, thus providing the best possible loop-free spanning tree for each sender terminal. By using the most efficient way RPF and RPB reduce the number of packets needed for broadcasting. In RPF each router must have information which path it would use for unicast-packets. When a packet arrives at the IS entry, it will be asked whether packets are normally also sent over this station for this source. If yes, then the packet will use the best route so far and will be resent over all edges (except the income one). If not, the packet does not use the best route and is discarded. Therefore, the most efficient way is then established, but RPF always requires a resend over all edges, which costs a lot of bandwidth capacity. In RPB is no resend over all edges. When the packet arrives at the IS entry, it will be asked whether the packets are normally also sent over this station for this specific source. If yes the edge will be selected at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to the specific source (in reversed direction).

Does this assumption hold for real INTERNET traffic? Explain your answer in 2-5 sentences.","No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",The assumption doesn't hold for real internet traffic because people usually use their connection in some time frames (for example watching Netflix) an then don't use ist fore some time (for example while sleeping) regularly.If there is a first packet more usually follow after that.

This results in an exponential growth as cwnd is essentially doubled after each Round Trip Time (RTT). This is done until either a packet is lost or ss_thresh is reached. When cwnd >= ss_thresh, the congestion avoidance phase is entered. After a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. Then cwnd is reset to 1. Congestion Avoidance (cwnd >= ss_thresh):: In the congestion avoidance phase, cwnd is incremented more slowly. There are different incrementation strategies, but they usually grow linearly, e.g. only increment cwnd by 1 after all sent segments have been acknowledged. This is done until a packet is lost. Typically, this means that cwnd less than ss_thresh and the slow start phase is entered again. After a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2.

The initial treshold value ss_tresh is the advertised window size. Loop: The sender sends TCP segments (amount of TCP segments = the value of cwnd) and waits for acknowledgements for the segments. Whenever an acknowledgement is received, cwnd is increased by 1. The sender repeats this action until the condition cwnd >= ssh_thresh holds (break condition). 2) Congestion avoidance Whenever a congestion occurs, the value of cwnd is reset to 1 and ssh_thresh is set to 50% of the current size of the window and we enter the slow-start phase again.","TThe response is partially correct because the slow start phase's description is missing how ss_thresh changes when a packet is lost.

653cda2102ae4a0ba5df63c18be2ede4,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","THE PURPOSE OF REVERSE PATH FORWARDING IS THAT THE INTERMEDIATE SYSTEMS (IS) DO NOT NEED TO KNOW THE SPANNING TREES. INSTEAD, EACH SENDER HAS ITS OWN SPANNING TREE. WHEN A PACKET ARRIVES AT AN IS IT CHECKS WHETHER THIS PACKET ARRIVED AT THE ENTRY PORT OVER WHICH THE PACKETS FOR THIS SENDER ARE USUALLY ALSO SENT, MEANING THAT NO OTHER PACKET FROM THE SAME SENDER ARRIVING AT THE IS HAS USED A BETTER ROUTE SO FAR. IF THIS IS THE CASE, THE INCOMING PACKET IS FORWARDED OVER ALL EDGES EXCEPT FROM THE INCOMING ONE. IF NOT, THE PACKET GETS DISCARDED SINCE IT IS NOT USING THE BEST ROUTE AND MOST LIKELY IS A DUPLICATE. The purpose of Reverse Path Broadcast is to prevent the resending over all edges as it is the case with Reverse Path Forwarding and instead only forward the packets over suitable edges. When a packet arrives at an IS, it also checks whether the packet used the best route until now like above. The difference is that in this case only the edge, at which the packets which are rerouted to the sender, arrive, is selected for forwarding the incoming packet. Key point is that path information gained by inspecting unicast packets is leveraged at each IS to prevent unnecessary transmissions.","The response correctly explains the RPF and RPB broadcasting algorithms. However, the purpose of both is to minimize the number of duplicate packets when broadcasting instead of eliminating the need for spanning trees.",Partially correct,0.8,0

EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.,"Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",A spanning try has no loops. When a spanning tree with all routers is known then a board- or multicast generates a minimal amount of packet copy's. LINK STATE ROUTING EXTENSION Every IS have to know the multicast tree and if it is a member of a multicast group or not.

212ae40f4da942859dc3973e267a30bf,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","The techniques ensure a loop-free forwarding of multicast packets. Reverse-Path-Forwarding: A node that receives a package of node b on the same line as node a would send his packages to b, thinks that the packages took the shortest way, and will distribute it to all other neighbors. If the package is received on another path, package will be discarded.","The purpose of RPF and RPB is not just limited to multicast but also broadcast.

a4517222d5c849898f32690c4ad4037d,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","There are several challenges that have to be faced for mobile routing. Two examples of the problems with this technology are the following: * Hidden Terminals mean, that several nodes in the mobile network do not know each other, but they know and transfer to common nodes in the middle. As an example, we can imagine that station A and C does not know about the existence of each other, but does know a station B in the middle. So A and C both try to transmit data to C, where then a collision of data packets occurs. * Exposed Terminals: A problem may occur, when to senders are in transmitting range of each other, but they are not able to detect the communication partner of each other. We can easily imagine a situation, where the stations B and C are in close proximity to each other, but where C cannot see B’s partner A and B cannot detect C’s partner D. If B wants to send data to A, which is not visible to C, C has to wait with its transmission, because he cannot be sure if his partner D is also blocked by B’s communication. In reality, C could send parallel to B, because their transmission partner are out of range of each other. So we have to solve this problem to achieve a better utilization of the channels, reach a higher throughput and enable an overall improved efficiency. * Inherent Heterogenity: As mobile networks contain several very different nodes, that run different software on very different hardware platforms, one has to think about the capabilities as well as the responsibilities of each node in the network. Therefore it is important to work out solutions to varifying capabilities in data processing, routing or transmitting for different participants in the network. * Dynamic Source Routing: Due to the flexibility of mobile networks, where participants / nodes may appear or disappear instantly in very different places, routes are by far less stable and static than in “normal” networks. So one has to implement strategies for route discovery in the routing algorithms, for example the topology-based Dynamic Source Routing in reactive routing protocols.",The three stated challenges are correct and complete.,Correct,1.0,0

b6954f2796c5415888e401dc62f6f89f,"To model the packet arrivals as a poisson process, we assumed that the arrivals for each time interval Δt are independent. Does this assumption hold for real INTERNET traffic? Explain your answer in 2-5 sentences.","No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.","No, it does not hold the assumption realistically. The poisson process implies that for every interval delta t there is a propability wich states if a packet was received or not. But for example, if we are watching a video stream, then we are watching it consecutively and hence, we have multiple delta t´s where packets are arriving.","The response points out that packets are received continuously while streaming, but in reality, they are received in bursts.

This results in an exponential growth as cwnd is essentially doubled after each Round Trip Time (RTT). This is done until either a packet is lost or ss_thresh is reached. When cwnd >= ss_thresh, the congestion avoidance phase is entered. After a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. Then cwnd is reset to 1. Congestion Avoidance (cwnd >= ss_thresh):: In the congestion avoidance phase, cwnd is incremented more slowly. There are different incrementation strategies, but they usually grow linearly, e.g. only increment cwnd by 1 after all sent segments have been acknowledged. This is done until a packet is lost. Typically, this means that cwnd less than ss_thresh and the slow start phase is entered again. After a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2.

This is continued till there is a packet loss or till the ss_thres threashold is reached. Phase 2) Congestion avoidance (cwnd>=ss_thresh; ss_thresh= advertised window size) Once there is a timeout, so if the a transmission runs into timeout, there is congestion. (timeout = congestion) if a congestion happens, the threshold ss_thres is set to the half, 50% of the size of the congestion window, the cwnd window is set to 1 again, the slow start is initialzed again. Slow start means that TCP slows down the increase of the cwnd window for the congestion window growing very fast and very rapidly for the case cwnd>=ss_thresh.","The response correctly states the name of the two phases. The explanation of the slow start phase is partially correct because when congestion is encountered in this phase, not only the window is reset to one, but also ss_thresh to cwnd/2.

This approach has the advantage that it handles duplicates very lightweight as the actual transport protocol does not need to care about duplicates when those are handled through binding the service to TSAPs. A disadvantage is that some services are per convention reached on a well-known TSAP (like e.g. a webserver at TCP port 80), where changing TSAPs would complicate finding the correct TSAP to connect to.Individual identification of connections: This method addresses duplicates by assigning each connection a SeqNo meaning a unique identifier that is remembered by the participating endsystems. This has the advantage that services can still be assigned to any well-known TSAP without conflict and this method solves receiving duplicate packages from a connection that has already been closed. A disadvantage is that the endsystems need to remember all previously assigned sequence numbers and those also need to be readily available, which would not be the case when e.g. the system is offline.Individual identification of PDUs: This method addresses duplicates be assigning each single PDU in all connections a unique SeqNo. This has the advantage that it definitely allows for uniquely identifying a package and immediately seeing whether we have seen this exact package before (and e.g. not just a equal package within the same connection).

885c9daf1dcc42a8a1b4c980b771559b,WHICH PROPERTY of spanning trees makes them appealing for broad- and multicasting? EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.,"Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)","Spanning Trees prevent loops in a network and therefore avoid the creation of duplicating packages. That is the reason why spanning trees are used for broad- and multicasting, because these packages are adressed to many (all) network participants, while a lot of connections may lead to loops which burden the network. To add spanning trees to the link state routing it would be necessary to alter the construction algorithm of the routing tables. The link state routing algorithm measures the distance to the adjacent nodes and contributes its information over the network. When every information is send out, then the nodes itself are able to locally compute a spanning tree. The network administrator would have to decide, which node will act as the root node, and then the nodes will have to use their best „shortest path“ for constructing a spanning tree.",The response correctly identifies the spanning-tree property that makes it appealing for broadcast and multicast.

Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","The network no longer has an ether to which all nodes are connected.

When cwnd >= ss_thresh, the congestion avoidance phase is entered. After a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. Then cwnd is reset to 1. Congestion Avoidance (cwnd >= ss_thresh):: In the congestion avoidance phase, cwnd is incremented more slowly.

d2281de049e148e9b86429ae67609e33,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","REVERSE PATH FORWARDING (RPF) is a technique used in modern routers for the purposes of ensuring loop-free forwarding of multicast packets in multicast routing and to help prevent IP address spoofing in unicast routing. Network administrators can use Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (Unicast RPF) to help limit the malicious traffic on an enterprise network. This security feature works by enabling a router to verify the reachability of the source address in packets being forwarded. The principle of RPF is each sender has its own Spanning Tree but IS does not need to know the Spanning Trees. Each router has information which path it would use for (unicast)-packets. Algorithm of RPF is as below: Has this packet arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent? Yes: Assumption: Packet used the BEST route until now Action: resend over all edges (not including the incoming one) No: Assumption: Packet did NOT use this route (it is NOT the best route) Action: discard packet (most likely duplicate REVERSE PATH BROADCAST (RPB) is an improvement on RPF. RPB not only evaluates the shortest path in relation to the interface on which the multicast packets are received, but also influences the forwarding of the data to the interface of the router. As a result, the multicast packets are only forwarded to the interfaces at which the next router is in the opposite direction on the shortest path to the data source. To be able to make the decision about forwarding, the routers must be informed about the shortest paths. TRPB routing is an extension of RPB routing. It ensures that the multicast packets do not get into subnets in which there are no current group members. The principle of RPB is every router forwards a broadcast packet to every adjacent router, except the one where it received the packet. A router u accepts a broadcast packet p originating at router s only if p arrives on the link that is on the direct (unicast) path from u to s. The Algorithm of RPB is as below: Has this packet arrived at THE IS entry over which the packets for this station/source S are usually also sent? YES: Packet used the BEST route until now? YES: select the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source S (in reversed direction) NO: DO NOT send over all edges (without the incoming one), i.e., not as in Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) NO: discard packet (is most likely a duplicate)",The stated purposes are correct but they are not limited to unicast and multicast instead used widely in broadcast too.

3c97ff55147e4c2e9064acf80ae81be1,WHICH PROPERTY of spanning trees makes them appealing for broad- and multicasting? EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.,"Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)","In Broad/Multicast the goal is to reach the whole network or a group to share the resources as efficient as possible. For Broadcast, a simple algorithm like Flooding can be used. The algorithm is very robust, but there is lots of overhead because of the many potential duplicates in the network. With a spanning tree the number of packets, especially the duplicates, can be minimized/limited. In multicast, this spanning tree can then also be reduced to the nodes belonging to the group. To get such a spanning tree different protocols as for example Distance Vector or Link State routing can be used. For Link State routing, every node sends the information of all his neighbor nodes to everyone. With this information, the nodes can reconstruct the whole network and use e.g. Dijkstra Algorithm to get a spanning tree. For Multicast, each node also sends the information in the packets to which group they belong, so there can be also determined a multicast path by every node. A multicast spanning tree is created.","The response does not state why spanning trees minimize duplicates. That is because they are loop-free. Apart from that, the response is correct.",Partially correct,0.75,0

677d5cb26b184d678336f56b013495fa,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","Routing in mobile networks is different than to fixed networks. It depends on many factors such as a faster changing network topology (faster moving nodes), distance when sending depends on the environment, the strength of the signal, the frequency, etc. Security issue plays a crucial role in mobile than in fixed settings. Two challenges of mobile routing are hidden terminals and exposed terminals. HIDDEN TERMINALS: We consider this relationship: A-B-C. A and B are sending, and each of them has a certain distance where they can communicate. A-B has a certain radius so B can listen to A. If C is sending something, B can listen to C. If A wants to send something and does the CSMA (carrier sense multiple access), it then listens to whatever it is on the channel, even if C is sending, A will not be able to hear it. Therefore if A sends something to B, and at the same time, C sends something to B, there will be interference. That means if B is sending something, A and C listen to it. If A and C send something, the other side doesn't get this information. Still, B receives the information. A sends to B, C cannot receive it, C sends something to B, a collision occurs at B. A is hidden for C, and C is hidden for A. EXPOSED TERMINALS: We consider this relationship: A-B-C-D. Exposed terminals are an underutilization of the channel. B wants to send to A and has a specific area where something can be seen (area includes nodes: A, B, and C). At the same time, C wants to send something to D. This could work because D will not get the data from B, and A will not get the data from C. At the same time, at the same channel, and the same frequency B can send something to A and C can send something to D, this is possible, but in the middle, some other nodes may have waste around. Therefore C has to wait. If we don't do anything, we would tell everybody to wait. If A is out of the scope of D, then we can send something. → this is described as underutilization. Therefore, additional protocol and agreement between C and B should be done. If B is sending to A and then C starts sending a request to send to D, then they have to know that D is not being within the distance of A. They have to know that one node cannot see the other one at the same time. Therefore CSMA/CD doesn't fit at this point.","The response correctly describes the hidden terminal challenge. In the second exposed terminal challenge, C has to wait because it detects the channel to be busy as B is sending and not because ""there are nodes in between which have waste around"".",Partially correct,0.875,0

When cwnd >= ss_thresh, the congestion avoidance phase is entered. After a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. Then cwnd is reset to 1. Congestion Avoidance (cwnd >= ss_thresh):: In the congestion avoidance phase, cwnd is incremented more slowly. There are different incrementation strategies, but they usually grow linearly, e.g. only increment cwnd by 1 after all sent segments have been acknowledged. This is done until a packet is lost. Typically, this means that cwnd less than ss_thresh and the slow start phase is entered again. After a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2.

db9c7334f0a342e38a15a5e296356f36,WHICH PROPERTY of spanning trees makes them appealing for broad- and multicasting? EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.,"Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)","The goal of multicasting is to reach multiple - all in the case of broadcasting -other nodes in a network. A spanning tree contains the minimal amount of hops to reach all destinations which makes it a perfect candidate for this purpose. In Link State Routing, this tree is shared across all nodes. Link state packets now also contain information about the multicast groups. The nodes now calculate separate spanning trees depending on the new information from other nodes. Now, we have a spanning tree for each multicast group which can be used to send the data on the shortest path.","Spanning trees are used for broadcasting because they are loop-free and hence, reduce duplicates, and do not necessarily contain paths with minimal hops.

EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.,"Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)","The most important property of the spanning trees is that they do not contain loops, this is appealing to the broad- and multicasting , because the amount of outgoing lines will be reduced , making also the number of packets smaller and the number of repeated packets will decrease. In the case of the multicast, all IS belonging to the group have to know the multicast tree, that is why link state routing is appropriate. It is important to know that the basis of this kind of routing is that all neighbors send each other their own link state packet in which they have information about the costs that their own adjacent links have.","The response is missing how link-state routing can be modified to construct a spanning tree.

If many radio ranges of terminals overlap, a terminal will always wait if it recognises somebody else sending in its range. Even if it would not cause interference in some cases because the waiting terminal would like to send to someone else who is not receiving anything.

Advantage :it is more efficient than carrier extension as single frames not filled up with garbage. Disadvantage :need frames waiting for transmission or buffering and delay of frames","Using ""frame bursting"", multiple frames are concatenated sequentially and sent at once.

Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)","The purpose of both is to forward broadcast packets without forward loops. - Spanning Trees are loop free, so recieving duplicate packages is impossible - In case of having a single spanning tree for the whole network, one node has to be chosen by some alogirthm or manually to be the root node. After this the root node can announce itself through the link state packages as the root of the tree. All other nodes send then their multicast packets to this node, which then get forwarded loop free to their destinations","The response correctly answers why a spanning-tree usage is ideal in multicast and broadcast.

For example, in one step we might use link C-F, and then in the next step we'd use E-I (because the load of E-I is lower at that moment). With the utilization of different links changing, we would keep switching between the two links instead of using the same path.

7e881eae13714b11bb01e8a2df222f41,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast aim to reduce the number of packet copies in the network. In Reverse Path Forwarding, a node forwards a packet if the packet used the entry over which the packets for the source would be sent. This means, if the packet used the best-known route, the node then forwards to all edges, except the incoming one. In Reverse Path Broadcast, a node forwards a packet if the packet arrived at the IS entry over which the packets would be sent to the source station (used the best-known route). If the packet arrived on the best-known route, the node forwards the packet to selected edges: the edges used to reroute on the reverse direction to the source. Example of RPB: If a node A is not in the best-known route from B to C, then A will not forward a packet to B when the packet source is C.",The response correctly explains the RPF and RPB algorithms including their purpose.,Correct,1.0,0

c68601d0dfda4b78bd8d466d5ef2ada3,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","Security challenges occur, because a mobile network may reach outside a building and can be seen from adversaries easily. This is not a challenge compared to wired networks, where cables end at end nodes and certain packets from the intranet can be dropped automatically.

045d09ebb87a4d7c900cd539906ef712,What is the “Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)”? What is it used for?,"The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used in Internet Protocol (IP) networks, whereby a DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on the network. Further, DHCP has largely replaced RARP (and BOOTP) Uses of DHCP are: Simplifies installation and configuration of end systems. Allows for manual and automatic IP address assignment. May provide additional configuration information (DNS server, netmask, default router, etc.)","Without DHCP or similar protocols, the administrator of a network element or computer needs to assign an unused IP address in the adequate network range to the device by hand. DHCP is a protocol to ease this process and to provide network elements with an IP address in an automated way. This can be a manual or an automatic assignment. In manual mode, a specific IP address will be permanently assigned to a certain MAC address. In automatic mode, an IP address will be temporarily assigned (lease) and freed if no renewal occurs. This provides efficient use of addresses without blocking addresses if no device uses it. The DHCP server is configured to manage a pool of possible IP addresses in the network and also knows other configuration data (e.g. DNS, netmask). The DHCP protocol also allows to configure the network elements with other important network details like DNS servers, netmask, default router, and other items. If a network element needs to join a network, it sends a broadcast message (DISCOVER) to the network. A DHCP server picks this message up and provides the necessary information to the network element as described above. There should not be more than 1 DHCP server in a network. If the DHCP server resides on another LAN segment, a DHCP relay agent can forward the respective messages to/from the DHCP server.",The response answers the definition and the usage of DHCP correctly. There can be more than 1 DHCP server for a subnet provided the address range is unique for both of them so that there are no overlapping addresses they can allot.,Correct,1.0,0

40e0107f7891406b99225e2965d8b780,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","Broadcast Routing with individual sending to every destination is bad because of Waste of bandwidth and the Sender has to know all destinations. Also, Flooding is not good because too many duplicates will exist. That's why Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast is used. Reverse Path Forwarding has the following algorithm implemented: Has this packet arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent? - Yes: resend over all edges (not including the incoming one) - No: discard the packet (most likely duplicate) Reverse Path Broadcast has the following algorithm implemented: Has this packet arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent? - Yes: Packet used the BEST route until now? - Yes: select the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source S (in reversed direction) ﻿﻿ - No: DO NOT send over all edges (without the incoming one), i.e., not as in Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) - No: discard the packet (most likely duplicate)",The response correctly explains RPF and RPB and their purpose.,Correct,1.0,0

See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","- Mobile routing requires more frequent route recomputation because connection conditions can change quickly, e.g. if a mobile device user enters or leaves a building. - While routing in fixed/wired networking normally tries to use the shortest path, this might not be the preferred metric for mobile networks because some paths could have higher cost (money) or energy consumption.","The first challenge is correct. However, the second challenge does not differentiate wireless networking from fixed networking. Even in wired networks, the shortest path is not always optimal and may depend upon other metrics too.",Partially correct,0.5,0
ee7882bd40eb4bb08fb24b7834ed897c,WHICH PROPERTY of spanning trees makes them appealing for broad- and multicasting? EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.,"Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",Spanning Trees prevent loops in your topology. You only have to modify the link state packets by adding information on multicast groups. With that information each IS can calculate a multicast tree,The response correctly identifies the spanning-tree property and explains how the Link State Routing can be modified to construct a spanning tree.,Correct,1.0,0

Does this assumption hold for real INTERNET traffic? Explain your answer in 2-5 sentences.","No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.","This assumption does not hold for the real internet traffic. Data packets are often sent in bursts or packet trains, especially in applications such as streaming. Therefore, over a higher time scale the probability of multiple arrivals of data packets one after another is high and no longer independent from one another.

HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).",Reverse path forwarding purpose: Broadcasting methods with reduction of duplicates Reverse path forwarding working: Each sender has an own spanning tree but IS does not know them.

1ec2ad0f263d4790bc8663dc8bd2d0f5,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","Hidden Terminals: Two nodes that reach out to a third node but cannot hear each other are prone to collisions at the receiving node, because both of them sense a free medium. To mitigate the collisions, the receiver e.g. could send a busy tone on a separate frequency to signal all other nodes in range that another node is sending to it, thus avoiding any collisions. Exposed Terminals: A node A in range of another node B is affected by its ""medium in use"" signal.

When cwnd >= ss_thresh, the congestion avoidance phase is entered. After a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. Then cwnd is reset to 1. Congestion Avoidance (cwnd >= ss_thresh):: In the congestion avoidance phase, cwnd is incremented more slowly. There are different incrementation strategies, but they usually grow linearly, e.g. only increment cwnd by 1 after all sent segments have been acknowledged. This is done until a packet is lost.

EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.,"Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)","Spanning trees are interesting for broad- and multicasting because they represent a subset of a graph that contains all nodes but no loops. If every router in the network knows about the structure of the spanning tree, it can simply forward a received broadcast to the remaining spanning tree lines without creating duplicates or not using the bandwidth optimally. In the Link State algorithm all stations have information about the existing other stations and can create a model of the topology by themselves. This model can then be used to create a spanning tree that fulfills the advantages mentioned above.","To calculate the spanning trees, you have to know which nodes belong to which groups.

Does this assumption hold for real INTERNET traffic? Explain your answer in 2-5 sentences.","No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.","An important characteristic of the Poisson distribution is that the probability of x taking a discrete value is independent upon the previous values i.e. the probability is independent of the past. Poisson distribution is often used to model arrival of packets during an interval. The packet arrival times modeled by the Poisson distribution have an exponential distribution and constitute an independent identically distributed process. However, in practice it has been shown that the packet inter-arrival times do not have an exponential distribution, hence the error introduced by modeling them as Poisson distribution is significantly large.","The question asks whether it is true that the arrivals at a node depend on previous arrivals at the same node for real internet traffic.

4e462108d4774886bdca27f5b1476918,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","Assume we have a network topology (A,B,C) with B is in the middle. A can talk with B, B can talk with C. But A and C is not in range of each other, so they can not hear each other. We have 2 challenges: -Hidden Terminal: Because A and C can not hear each other, it could be that case, that A and C send data to B at the same time and each of them still thinks it's only one who's sending to B at the moment. As a result, collision happens at node B. =>That's the wasting of network resources. Assume we have a network topology A,B,C,D. -Exposed Terminal: If B wants to send data to A and C wants to send data to D. Logically, it's fine, since there is no collision here.(No case that 2 device are sending to same device). But in this case, C has to wait until B has finished.

Advantage :it is more efficient than carrier extension as single frames not filled up with garbage. Disadvantage :need frames waiting for transmission or buffering and delay of frames","The solution for maintaining a high collision domain diameter with increased transmission speed is to also increase the length of the sent frames. Frame bursting in this context means combining multiple small frames to one concatenated sequence of then increased length. This allows collision detection on the same length of line as before with increased speed because incread sequence length and higher transmission speed together mean a unchanged duration of transmission for every node in the network. We have to have a look on the advantages and disadvantages of frame bursting, especially in comparison to carrier extension. Carrier extension is another attempt to longer frames by adding more zero-padding bits to every frame with the same data section length as before: -Advantage: In comparison to carrier extension, the long sequences in frame bursting contain more information, because no (or at least less) zero padding is needed. So the percentage of data per sequence is higher than it is with carrier extension, where most of the package consists of padding fields. So we have a higher efficiency, especially in respect of line usage. -Disadvantage: Frame bursting needs time of waiting for every node before sending, because a certain amount of frames has to be collected to concatenate them to a sequence of minimum length. So the delay of sending is increased. One has also to think about the best trade-off between waiting time and frame collection, for example when to stop waiting and adding padding zeros.","The response correctly explains the frame bursting definition, its advantage and disadvantage.",Correct,1.0,0

Does this assumption hold for real INTERNET traffic? Explain your answer in 2-5 sentences.","No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.","No this assumption does not hold for real internet traffic. Real Internet Traffic has built in congestion and flow control mechanisms, therefore if the packets get dropped due to queue buffer overflow from high arrival rate, there would be missing ACK messages detected at the sender side. Therefore the rate of transmission from sender will drop or slow down to compensate for slow receiver. In this sense the arrivals at each time interval are not really independent.","While the congestion does affect the arrival dependency at a node,  the main cause is how data is sent normally, which is in bursts.",Partially correct,0.75,0

Disadvantage :need frames waiting for transmission or buffering and delay of frames","To still be able to detect collisions at a high speed (as in the Gigabit Ethernet protocol), longer packets are needed. There are several options to form a larger frame size and one of them is frame bursting. In this method a set of shorter packets is concatenated and then all the packets are sent together as one large frame. The advantage of this method is that there is a high efficiency/high throughput, as every part of a frame consists of usable data in comparison to carrier extension where padding is added to every frame and only a short percentage of a frame contains data. The disadvantage of this method is a higher end-to-end delay as we need to wait in order for the buffer to fill up, which poses a disadvantage especially in interactive services. In comparison, the carrier extension method is much faster because every packet is sent directly.

Instead a 3 phased communication with connect and disconnect, and flow control","1. „Unconfirmed Connectionless Service“ Within the first of these service classes, the data sent will arrive at the receiver without any acknowledgement of the sender. This means the sender does not know if the data arrives and if it is complete or not. So loss of data units is possible and there is no flow control. Additionally, during the data transfer there is no real connection between sender and recipient. The data units are transmitted isolated in only one direction as an answer to the data request. 2. „Confirmed Connectionless Service“ Compared to the first, within the second service class the receiver will let the sender know about the successful transmission of the data. If there is no acknowledgement from the recipient within a certain time frame, the data units will be send again. So there will not be any loss of data. But because of the retransmission there might be duplicates and sequence errors. Futhermore, this means there is no flow control as in the first service class and also no real connection between sender and receiver. Although the communictaion is not one-directional anymore. 3. „Connection-Oriented Service“ In contrast to the other two service classes, the third option offers flow control and connection between the participants of the data transfer. This comes with the advantage of no errors due to lost, duplicated or sequenced data. To make this way of data transfer possible there is a 3-phased communication between sender and receiver. Firstly, the connection between both is settled and the needed variables are initialised.

a24753dc30204b6ab6c728c240688901,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","One challenge is the problem that some nodes may be out of range or they have to use other peer nodes as routers to forward packets. Because of the fact of moving nodes and changing conditions, another challenge is that they need to find new routes which is highly dynamic and unpredictable.","While the second challenge of needing to be able to adapt to a dynamically changing environment is correct, the first challenge stated is not a challenge specific to mobile routing.

Does this assumption hold for real INTERNET traffic? Explain your answer in 2-5 sentences.","No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node.

The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.","This assumption does not hold in the real world, because, in the real world, networks must deal with bursty traffic, as well as times when there is no or very less traffic, and this change in traffic is dependent on a number of factors.

Please answer the question in 2-5 sentences.,"1.A mapping between destinations/stations (MACs) and outgoing LAN interfaces. 2.This table is initially empty and received packages are flooded on every line. When a bridge receives a frame (as the bridge runs in promiscuous mode it listens in on all the traffic arriving at its LAN links) with source address Q on LAN L, it adds the timestamped entry “Q can be reached over L” to the table and the next time a packet with destination Q arrives, it is forwarded on link L.

Therefore, we first calculate the probability of the system being full/having 10 packets in the queue. This is also called “blocking probability” or P_B. P_B = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^N) / 1 - utilization^(N+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508 Alternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate P(X less than 10) = (1 -P_B) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, …, 9 packets to be in the queue. To calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with P(X less than 10) or the complement of P_B (0.25p) = 60 * (1-P_B) = 56.9512 seconds","1. determine queuing model (Kendall's notation) - average arrival and service → exponentially distributed arrival and service process → A=B=M - single-server → C=1 - queue length (system provides room for up to 10 ""customers"")→ D=10 ⇒ M/M/1/10 2.

Calculate probability of system being in requested state: The requirement of having less than 10 packets in the queue is equivalent to the system not being blocked (full) because of D=N=10. Since the distribution is memoryless and we've reached equilibrium, the probability that the system is in a certain state does not depend on the time.

See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","-Hidden terminals : Between 3 nodes A,B,C Node A and C cannot listen to each other.

See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","ADAPTATION: Since users (nodes) might be moving around constantly, the network has to adapt to this changes (for example routing paths). SECURITY: Wireless communication leads to the problem, that everyone in the vicinity of a sender can receive a messagRe altough it is not meant for them.",Both the stated challenges are correct.,Correct,1.0,0

a7ea9fb66d684482996bd776167b1fd3,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","The purpose is to ensure a loop-free forwarding of multicast packets. Reverse Path Forwarding: When the packet arrived at the IS entry port, over which the packets for this station are usally also sent, we resend the packet over all edges except the incoming edge. If thats not the case we discard the packe, because its probably a duplicate. Reverse Path Broadcast: When the packet arrived at the IS entry port, over which the packets for this station are usally also sent, we check if the packet used the best route until now. If its the best route we select the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to the station.

When one station has many other station in its range, but just wants to send data to one specific, the other stations in its range have to wait.

There are different incrementation strategies, but they usually grow linearly, e.g. only increment cwnd by 1 after all sent segments have been acknowledged. This is done until a packet is lost.

26c4caeca4af4742a9c09ef2ee3483c6,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","The purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast is to reduce the network load. To perform Reverse Path Forwarding, each node must know which port to use to send (unicast-)packets to every other node. Incoming packets are then treated depending on the port, they arrive by. If they are received via the port used to send packets to the source, they are resent over all edges. If they are received over any other port, they did not use the best route and are discarded. Reverse Path Broadcast works slightly different. By observing the packets, a node forwards, it can learn, whether it is on the unicast path between any two nodes. If it now receives a broadcast packet from any source, it will forward the packet in all directions, where it is part of the unicast route to the source. For all other directions/neighbors it can assume, that they will receive the packet via their unicast route.","The response correctly explains both RPF and RPB.

Advantage :it is more efficient than carrier extension as single frames not filled up with garbage. Disadvantage :need frames waiting for transmission or buffering and delay of frames","In frame bursting, instead of the sender sending one packet at a time, it sends ten packets at once. The sender waits for the packets until it has ten packets ready to send. Put them together and just then send them. Advantage: better performance than carrier extension, since more data is sent at a time. Disadvantage: if there are only one or two packets to send, the sender will be waiting for the remain, to reach the 10 packets. If there are not 10 packets, after a timeout, the sender adds rubbish to the frame (so it has the needed size). So, the packets will be sent with a delay and with unnecessary data.","The response correctly answers the advantage and disadvantage part. However, the definition part is only partially correct as it states that the sender sends 10 packets at once, but there is no specification regarding the number of packets to be sent in one frame. The appropriate definition of frame bursting is that it reduces the overhead of transmitting small frames by concatenating a sequence of multiple frames in one single transmission.",Partially correct,0.75,0
bf95142ba73541f9b48229a5a1ed6a9a,WHICH PROPERTY of spanning trees makes them appealing for broad- and multicasting? EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.,"Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)","The spanning tree is a subset of subnets including all routers with no loops. This leads to a generation of a minimum number of packet copies. Link state routing can be modified by expanding the contained information of the periodically send link state packets with information on multicast groups. Because these link state packets are broadcasted to all the other IS, each IS can calculate a multicast tree from the now locally available and complete state information. Based on the information about the multicast tree the IS determines the outgoing lines on which the packets have to be retransmitted.",The response correctly identifies the spanning-tree property that makes it appealing for broadcast and multicast and how the link-state algorithm is modified to construct a  multicast spanning tree.,Correct,1.0,0

0bc7a5f4a235478c96c4cb467c76f501,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","Reverse Path Forwarding: If a node receives a packet which it should forward further, it determines, if the packet sender is in the direction of the incoming packet. If yes, the packet is on the best route and is sent via all other edges except the incoming. Otherwise, it's ignored, because it's moste likely a duplicate. Reverse Path Broadcast behaves similar in selecting if the packet should be forwarded. But, instead of sending it to all other nodes, it does not forward the packets to another node, if it knows that it is not on the best route for this given source and destination.","The response correctly explains RPB. The purpose of RPF and RPB to reduce duplicates in the network while broadcasting is missing.

Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms to check whether it would send a packet to the source using the incoming link.",Partially correct,0.6,0

EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.,"Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)","All nodes are connected at least one other, all nodes can be reached. Constructing a spanning tree: First measuring the distance to the neighbors, organize your package(send the distance), all nodes do the calculation which distances are the shortest.","Although all nodes are connected with at least one link, that is also the case in the original network. More importantly, they need to have only one unique path so that the number of duplicate messages can be minimized.

This is a very simple mechanism, but it introduces a lot of overhead for larger chunks of data, and also isn't suitable for high transmission rates. Synchronous transmission increases the header size, but in turn introduces so-called frames, which group multiple bytes together.

Instead a 3 phased communication with connect and disconnect, and flow control","For the Data Link Layer there are 3 service classes: unconfirmed conn.less service, confirmed conn.less service and connection-oriented service. In unconfirmed conn.less service a data is sent to receiver. In this case a sender does not know if the sent data has arrived at the receiver. In other words, we don't get any confirmation from the receiver about arrived data. In case of loss data the data will be not resend. If any Correct data arrives, there is no correcting mechanism implemented. Confirmed conn.less service is a bidirectional communication between sender and receiver. After a sender sends a frame, a receiver sends an acknowledgement as answer. In the case of loss data a frame will be retransmit (after timeout) as long as the sender gets an acknowledgement from the receiver. In confirmed conn.less service there is no flow control implemented. In the last kind of service, connection-oriented service, a connection between parties has to be estabilished firstly before we can send any data. We speak of 3-phased communication: connection estabilishment (a sender sends a request to receiver, the receiver confirms it); data transfer (after the receiver gets a frame, sends an acknowledgement to the sender); disconnection (analog to connection estabilishment).

6267c2f8f4ea464ba234229081d4082d,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","Broadcasting methods which were previously introduced such as individual sending to every destination and flooding have their own disadvantages. Individual sending wastes bandwidth and requires the sender to know all destinations. Flooding may produce too many duplicates. Broadcast routing like Reverse Path Fowarding and Reverse Path Broadcast can be used to avoid such problems. Specifically, Reverse path broadcast can be used to avoid another problem of Reverse path forwarding, since it forwards packets over suitable edges instead of resend them over all edges. Both algorithms use spanning tree for router initiating broadcast, which is based on a subset of subnets including all routers with no loops. Upon arrival of a packet at an IS, both algorithms make the following decisions: Forwarding: If the packet has arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent, the packet is resent over all edges excluding the incoming one. If not, the packet is discarded. Broadcast: If the packet has arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source S are usually also sent, and if the packet used the best route until now, the edge is selected at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source S, if not, the algorithm does not send over all edges, i.e., not as in Reverse path forwarding. Otherwise, the packet is discarded, since it is most likely a duplicate.",The response correctly explains the RPF and RPB algorithms and their purpose.,Correct,1.0,0

For that the client broadcasts a DHCP DISCOVER packet in the local network. If that request reaches the DHCP Server it offers the client a new IP-address and sends this back. The client then answers to this with an acknowledgement. As the IP-address is assigned for a limited time only, the client has to renew the “lease” before it expires.","The response is partially correct because it is not specific enough on how the IP address allocation process is done, whether it's automatically, manually, or dynamically.

eab3dffcea1b4dbba229ef0820e76b9a,What are extension headers in IPv6 and where are they located in a packet? What is the main advantage of extension headers compared to IPv4?,"Extension headers are used to extend the fixed IPv6 header with additional, optional network layer information. If present, they are located between the fixed header/main header and payload/upper-layer header/ transport-layer header. Main advantage: One of the following advantages are considered fully correct: 1. It allows the appending of new options without changing the header. 2. IPv6 packets with optional headers are typically processed faster/simpler by intermediate devices as most of the options are ignored (except “Hop-by-Hop Extension”) while they are processed by all routers in IPv4 unless ordered otherwise.","The functionality of options in IPv4 headers is removed and replaced from the main header through a set of so-called extension headers. They are additional headers in the IPv6 which are used for implementing more extensions. The main header has a fixed size of 40 bytes; the extensions headers, on the other hand, are optional and are added as needed. That means you can add extensions without planning it. There are several extension headers: Routing, Fragment, Destination, etc. The extension headers are placed between the fixed header and the payload. Every extension header points to the next header. There is also the possibility to refer to a ""No Next Header"" which is only to show that nothing else follows. It creates a chain, at the end of which is usually the TCP or UDP header. Extension headers are a way to extend the header and put additional information between the payload and the header. They are optional, and that's why we have an absolute efficiency gain comparing to IPv4. Because in IPv4, we had at least one part for the option reserved, but in IPv6, we can say there are no extension headers, and so we have a smaller header and, therefore, much more space for the payload. Also, extension headers result in a significant improvement in router performance for packets containing options. In contrast to IPv4, the extension headers are only examined by a router when a packet arrives at its final destination and not along their delivery path.","The response is partially correct because the option field in IPv4 is not mandatory, and it is often 0 bit long in practice. Therefore, the efficiency gain advantage is incorrect. Also, the hop-by-hop extension header needs to be examined by intermediate routers too.",Partially correct,0.75,0

Carrier extension ensures to reach the minimal frame size by using padding which may (!) result in a waste of brandwith. This is the case if you need to add a large padding to reach the minimum frame size. As a solution, frame bursting optimizes the relation between actual payload and padding.

e63bec957c114be5873fdc2d5cb2ab89,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","We learned about Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast regarding broadcast routing. 1. Reverse Path Forwarding / Reverse Path Flooding: The purpose of this algorithm is to efficiently distribute broadcast messages. Therefore, each sender maintains its own spanning tree. The spanning tree gives us information about how much does it cost to reach a node in a tree to deliver a unicast message. There can be different paths to reach this node from sender to recipient - the cheapest path is considered to be the best one. When a broadcast sender S sends a broadcast message to all nodes in the network (see slide 9) every node in the network checks: Is the broadcast message received via the best route the node itself would use to send a unicast message to S? - If it is true: then the node resends the broadcast messages via all edges in the network except the edge over which the broadcast message was received - Otherwise the node will ignore the broadcast message (duplicate) 2. Reverse Path Broadcast The purpose of this algorithm is to efficiently distribute broadcast messages. It basically works as Reverse Path Forwarding with one difference: When a broadcast sender S sends a broadcast message to all nodes in the network, every node selects specific edges which are used to resent the message. A node will resent the message via a specific edge if this node is typcially on the path to this node regarding the sending of unicast messages and if it is the best route until now.",The response correctly explains the RPF and RPB algorithms and their purpose.,Correct,1.0,0

The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.","No, it does not hold for real internet traffic. The amount of traffic normally varies throughout the day. Internet traffic is also often bursty, so when a packet got sent, more packets with a very short interarrival time will follow for the duration of the burst.

To simplify protocol processing with Simplified header. To increase security. To support real time data traffic (quality of service). Flow label, traffic class. To provide multicasting. To support mobility (roaming). To be open for change (future): extension headers for additional change incorporation. To coexistence with existing protocols.","The first main objective for the introduction of IPv6 was the support of more addresses in the network. While IPv4 with 4 byte addresses only allowed roughly about 4 billion participants, IPv6 enables up to 2^128 addresses, what should be enough for the next centuries. This enlargement of the address room became important with the introduction of mobile computing, smart home and internet of things. The second objective was to simplify the process of forwarding and building routing tables by simplifying the header of IPv6-addresses, which are now easier and faster to decode for routers. Furthermore, the way IPv6 addresses are handled in a network allowed a higher level of security in comparison to IPv4. IPv6 allows better guarantees for Quality of Service, especially for real time traffic. This is also due to changes of the header of such an IP-packet. Another important lesson learnd from the development history of IPv4 and therefore a main objective for IPv6 was to make it adaptive to future developments: So the IPv6 protocol allows introduction of extension headers for future functionalities.",All four objectives of IPv6 mentioned in the response are completely accurate.,Correct,1.0,0

53042799a96f4b3283ee54d4621fa736,What is the difference between asynchronous and synchronous transmission mode in the Data Link Layer.,"Asynchronous transmission: Every character a self-contained unit surrounded by a start bit and a stop bit, which is an easy and cheap pattern, but causes low transmission rates. Synchronous transmission: Several characters pooled to a continuous stream of data (frames), Frames defined by SYN or flag, higher complexity, but higher transmission rates. Requires synchronization between sender and receiver.",In the asynchronous or byte-oriented mode a byte is always send in a small frame which only contains the byte as well as a stop and start bit. This simplifies sender and receiver logic. In the synchronous mode multiple characters are send together in a frame. Frames are started and stopped by more complex data. This results in better efficiency as very little extra data is send with every frame (compared to the 2 bit overhead for every 8 bits in asynchronous mode),The response answers the differences correctly.,Correct,1.0,0

Please answer the question in 2-5 sentences.,"1.A mapping between destinations/stations (MACs) and outgoing LAN interfaces. 2.This table is initially empty and received packages are flooded on every line. When a bridge receives a frame (as the bridge runs in promiscuous mode it listens in on all the traffic arriving at its LAN links) with source address Q on LAN L, it adds the timestamped entry “Q can be reached over L” to the table and the next time a packet with destination Q arrives, it is forwarded on link L. The time-stamp is used to update or purge old entries. Therefore, it learns by observing the incoming traffic. 3.To do selective forwarding instead of flooding. 4.i)less duplication/unnecessary flooding is prevented. ii)less congestion. iii)better bandwidth usage than flooding.","The table consists of multiple entries. When a Bridge receives a frame from source Q on LAN L (for the first time) then it adds an entry to it’s table consisting of Q, L and a timestamp. This entry indicates that Q is reachable via L. The timestamp is used to purge old entries and adapt to changes in the topology. A timestamp of an entry is updated whenever a new frame is received from the same sourcenode. If the bridge then receives a frame from a different LAN with the destination Q, it looks up in the table and finds that Q is reachable via L and forwards it to L.

Name the 2 phases of congestion control and explain how the Congestion Window (cwnd) and the Slow Start Threshold (ss_thresh) change in each phase (after initialization, where cwnd = 1 and ss_thresh = advertised window size) in 1-4 sentences .","Slow start (cwnd less than ss_thresh): In the slow start phase, cwnd is incremented by one every time a segment is acknowledged. This results in an exponential growth as cwnd is essentially doubled after each Round Trip Time (RTT). This is done until either a packet is lost or ss_thresh is reached. When cwnd >= ss_thresh, the congestion avoidance phase is entered. After a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. Then cwnd is reset to 1. Congestion Avoidance (cwnd >= ss_thresh):: In the congestion avoidance phase, cwnd is incremented more slowly. There are different incrementation strategies, but they usually grow linearly, e.g. only increment cwnd by 1 after all sent segments have been acknowledged. This is done until a packet is lost. Typically, this means that cwnd less than ss_thresh and the slow start phase is entered again. After a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. Then cwnd is reset to 1.","Congestion control with TCP consists of two phases: slow start (also getting to equilibrium) and congestion avoidance. In the first phase we want to find the equilibrium point very fast: we start a connection with initialize cwnd (Congestion Window) equals 1. After every transmission we double cwnd until the value of ss_thresh is reached or a packet get lost. When this is the case, the first phase ends and the second starts. In the second phase an additive increase takes place - after every transmission we add 1 to cwnd. If a timeout occurs or a packet gets lost, the value of cwnd decreases multiplicative.","The response correctly states the name of the two phases. The Slow start phase's explanation is partially correct because it does not note what happens when congestion occurs in this phase. Additionally, the first phase continues if congestion occurs in the first phase rather than moving to the second phase.

59639515d421421faffd34f93b07b51c,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","Hidden Terminal: If multiple nodes are hidden from each other(i.e. can´t hear each other), the transmission to a common node in between the two nodes may result in a collision at the receiving node.The hidden nodes may send at the same time as the second sender senses a ""free"" medium (carrier sense fails) and the first sender cannot detect the collision (collision detection fails). Exposed Terminals: Exposed Terminals problem occurs when one node is prevented from sending packets to another other node due to a neighbouring transmitting node. If two nodes can hear each other and try to send to different receivers, which are out of range of eachother, but the transmitters are in each others radio range the transmission of the second sending node fails.

Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)","A spanning tree is a tree that connects all edges in a graph with the minimum number of possible edges. In this way, spanning trees help in avoiding loops while connecting all the edges in a graph that makes them good for building networks for broad and multicasting. The already existing LSR can be used to construct a spanning tree for multicasting, first, each node must find the shortest path to all other nodes(Linked State Path/LSP), and every time the network changes, this must be repeated and new LSPs must be calculated. These LSPs wil be the only paths used to communicate between the nodes.",The response correctly answers why using a spanning tree is a good idea in multicast and broadcast.

EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.,"Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)","A spanning tree ensures that all members of the network/group are reached by using as less links as possible. Link State is modified by the information of which IS belongs to which group. So every IS knows that it belongs to a certain group and distributes this information in addition to the existing link state distribution packets. Based on this information, every IS can calculate a spanning tree for each group.","Though spanning trees have a minimal number of links, the primary reason for them being used in the multicast and broadcast is an avoidance of unnecessary duplicates by removing loops.

Depending on which requirements are more important, it's a tradeoff between cost, throughput and adding new users. Ultimately, for the present case, I would choose the non-persistent CSMA/CD. Non-persistent because it improves overall throughput (efficiency). CSMA/CD has lower costs compared to Token Ring (cost efficient), which is important to the company as funding is tight. Also, with CSMA/CD it is easier to add new users/stations (connect stations without shutting down the network). (I think, one could also choose p-persistent CSMA with small p, since the performances of p-persistent with small p and non-persistent are very similar at high load (slide 29) and p-persistent is a compromise between delay and throughput.) However, the disadvantage of CSMA/CD is that the number of collisions increases as the utilization increases, and there is poor throughput during high utilization periods. One disadvantage of non-persistent is that there are longer delays for single stations. For me, the cost and the simplicity of adding a new user were the main factors in favor of CSMA/CD, since Token Ring is much more expensive and it is more complex to add a new user.","This is correct, Mr. Flipper",Correct,3.5,2

Does this assumption hold for real INTERNET traffic? Explain your answer in 2-5 sentences.","No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.","No, it does not hold the assumption. The arrivals are more or less bundled because the packages are arriving after each other when you use the internet. They are arriving more or less in a small timespan.

74724f5bc59a4dbda33b41a2e449d8b2,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","These both methods are able to realize the broadcast routing upon a network. Reverse path forwarding (RPF): A sender broadcasts to all stations on the network. When a packet arrived at an IS, the IS will check if this path is the one which is usually used to communicate with the sender or not. If yes, the IS is able to resend the packet to all stations except the incoming one. If not, the IS will discard the packet. Reverse Path Broadcast (RPB): It is almost like a improved version of RPF. If the packet reaches the IS entry over which the packets for this station/source S are usually also sent and the Packet has used the best route until now, select the edge at which the packet arrives, and then reroute it from that edge to the source S (reverse) , If no Packet has not used the best route until now, do not send over all edges (without incoming edges), i.e., not as in the Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF). If the packet does not reach the IS entry port, then the packet is discarded (the most likely duplicate).","The stated purpose is missing the goal of minimizing the number of duplicate packets during broadcasting. Additionally, the description of RPB is slightly incorrect regarding discarding the packet if it ""does not reach the IS entry port"". Instead, the packet is discarded if it has not arrived at the IS entry, over which packets for this station/source are usually sent.",Partially correct,0.6,0

EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.,"Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)","A spanning tree has only one connection to every node of the network. If it is used for broadcasting, no unnecessary duplicates are needed since every duplicate reaches a destination node. This means unlike Flooding under any circumstances only on packet arrives at each node. If you have a spanning tree containing all nodes of a multicast, the same works for multicasting. Link State Routing usually uses Flooding to find the shortest path to a certain node in this case you use flooding to find a spanning tree by only returning paths to nodes which have not been found yet.","The modification description of the link-state algorithm to construct a  multicast spanning tree is not correct as the IS nodes are not aware of all multicast group members. This information needs to be shared along with other link-state information. So the spanning tree constructed out of only the classic link-state algorithm is only useful for unicasting, not multi-/broadcast.",Partially correct,0.5,0

43a0597d2ecf4890931e896ca3bb7be0,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","1) Hidden Terminals: If two nodes want to send some data to a common node, they choose a medium that they assume is free. If the two sending nodes are not in range of each other, they could choose the same medium as a receiver, because they have no way of knowing that the other one is already sending something to the receiving third node. This causes a collision at the receiving node. 2) Near and Far Terminals - depending on the distance between devices, a weaker signal - of the distant device - can be drowned out by a closer device that has a much stronger signal because it is closer to the receiver. This can prevent the receiver from receiving the transmission of the distant device.",The response correctly states and describes two challenges of mobile routing.,Correct,1.0,0

114c78adfd184aa1ac160e63e36196e1,WHICH PROPERTY of spanning trees makes them appealing for broad- and multicasting? EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.,"Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)","Spanning Trees, which form a subset of all subnets including all routers have the main posivite property that they do not include any loops. So transmission along a spanning tree is also loop-free and therefore more efficient than a “wild” transmission in all direction for all nodes (flooding). To implement a spanning tree in Link State Routing, all nodes have to know the common spanning tree. To achieve this, all nodes send link state packets periodically, which include information about the distance to its neighbours as well as multicast-group information. Those packets are broadcasted to all nodes. Then, all nodes can calculate (and later improve) the multicast tree with the completed state information, which then determines the outgoing lines for further transmission.",The response correctly identifies the spanning-tree property that makes it appealing for broadcast and multicast and how the link-state algorithm is modified to construct a  multicast spanning tree.,Correct,1.0,0

For example, there are the following four differences between the headers of the two protocols: - First of all, TCP includes a sequence number for sending to ensure that all packages can be organized by the receiver in the same order as they were sent. UDP does not give any information about the right sequence of packages, so there is no guarantee for the order that the receiver gets or can create. - Furthermore, TCP gives reliability to the users by also including a field for acknowledgements in the header. To be more precise, the included sequence number works as an acknowledgement for a package receiver earlier. On the other hand, UDP does not give any guarantee concerning reliability of service, so there is no space in the header for any kind of acknowledgement. - What is more, TCP includes possibilities for flow and congestion control by dynamically adjusting the window size for sending and receiving packets at the same time. This process makes use of the “Advertised window” field in the header which can be used by a receiver to transmit its optimal window size for reception of packets. UDP on the other hand does not include such features, so there is no space for windowing in the header. - Finally, TCP also gives the user possibilities to prioritize packages for urgent processing at the receiver process. Therefore, the header includes the so called 16-bit “Urgent Pointer” which is an offset to the sequence number and marks the last octet of a sequence of highly prioritized packets. UDP does not have any included features for marking urgent data, so there is also no mechanism like the urgent pointer in the UDP header.",The response correctly identifies four differences between TCP and UDP headers.,Correct,1.0,0

This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","Two challenges in Mobile Routing are Hidden Terminals and Exposed Terminals. With Hidden Terminals, the challenge occurs when two nodes that are not in range of each other both try to communicate with another node that they are both in reach with. For example node A and C are not in range of each other but can both communicate with node B. Now when node A sends something to B, then C cannot receive this transmission. Because of that C will think that B is free for transmission and might also send data to B. This simultaneous transmission will result in a collision and a loss of data from both A and C. With Exposed Terminals we imagine the example from above with another node D that is only in range of C. Now if B is sending data to A and C wants to send data to D. C will then see that the carrier is busy and has to wait until it detects it to be idle.

5e0e897a38dc46dc94038c873d260e8a,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","With reverse path forwarding, loops are avoided. Each sender has its own spanning tree, but the IS doesnt need to know all. While sending, ,stations pass the packets to the particular subnets. In RPF, packets see a reachable list of stations when arriving at a station, and are eventually transmitted to all substations. With Reverse Path broadcast, packet paths are sent over the usually used path if they arrived via the most used path, else the are sent via a selected edge.","The purpose is partially correct as it is only referring to RPF and does not explain how loops avoid duplicates forwarding during broadcasting. In RPF, there is no mention or description of the optimal path and how unicast information is used to derive that.

Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.","No, in real internet traffic the probability for arrivals in each time interval are not always independent.

EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.,"Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)","A Spanning tree is a tree structure with only one active path, that connects any two nodes (i.e. there are no loops in the routing table). This avoids duplicate packets (reduces the network load) and it also helps to maintain less routing information. To modify Link State routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting first it determines the address of adjacent IS. Then it measures the distance to “the directly adjacent IS”. After that, it organizes the local link-state information in a packet. And it distributes the information to all IS. Finally, it calculates the ideal spanning tree based on the information of all IS.","The response correctly answers why a spanning-tree usage is ideal in multicast and broadcast.

Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","Mobile Routing has different challenges, since communication does not happen on a wired medium and is therefore broadcast by nature. 1. Hidden Terminals: If two nodes, A and C, can't hear each other due to their distance, and there is a node B located in the intersection of their transmission, their transmissions can collide at node B without A and C noticing it. CSMA/CD does not work here, since A and C will not hear each other and can therefore not detect a collision. 2. Exposed terminal problem: Station B transmits to station A at the same time C wants to transmit to D. If C senses the medium. it will hear a transmission and falsely conclude that it may not send to D, but it’s unnecessary because these two transmissions don’t interfere each other.

When cwnd >= ss_thresh, the congestion avoidance phase is entered. After a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. Then cwnd is reset to 1. Congestion Avoidance (cwnd >= ss_thresh):: In the congestion avoidance phase, cwnd is incremented more slowly. There are different incrementation strategies, but they usually grow linearly, e.g. only increment cwnd by 1 after all sent segments have been acknowledged. This is done until a packet is lost.

c05af36592454a3faca2a726d21c133e,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) and Reverse Path Broadcast (RPB) are both routing algorithms for broadcasting. They both try to reduce the duplicates in comparison to flooding, by implicitly building a spanning tree. RPB is a modification of RPF. In RPF each IS decides whether it forwards an incoming packet via all outgoing links based on the information if the packet arrived over the link that is usually used to send unicast packets to the source. In RPB this decision is also made but, the packet is then only forwarded on specific links, in the reverse way packages are forwarded normally in unicast communications. RPB reduces duplicates more than RPF, but also becomes less reliable.","In both algorithms, the packet is also not forwarded to the edge from which it was received.",Partially correct,0.9,0

Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","1.Hidden Terminals Image 1: There are three nodes as A, B, C In the network.

2a39bc72824f43e294bb7cb93782fea1,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","Challenges in Mobile routing are different from fixed and wired networks because the topography in mobile networks is always changing. Hidden Terminals are formed when 2 nodes in a network are too far apart to be able to listen to eachother, but are both visible to other nodes in their range. This can lead to collisions at nodes that can hear both nodes. RTS/CTS is used to fix this problem. Exposed Terminals are a problem when there are many nodes in the network and RTS/CTS is in use. For example, given 4 nodes, A, B, C, D, B wants to communicate with A, and so B sends A an RTS, in response, A sends everyone in the channel a CTS. At the same time, C wants to send to D, but due to A's CTS, has to wait for the duration specified, even though D is outside A's network range, so the communication between A and B poses no threat to C and D's communication.",The response is partially correct because the description of the exposed terminal challenge is incorrect.

6c98ad301a1c4ab6802dd901cef37575,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcasting is done, to find the shortest way to each recipient of a multicast message while minimizing the amount of copies sent in a network. Both principles work on the same foundation: Each router has the information which path it would use for a unicast transmission. The sender then starts to broadcast a package to all its connected neighbors. The neighboring routers then determine, whether the incoming package has used the best route to reach him. The best route in this case, is the one you would normally use in a unicast transmission. If the incoming package has NOT taken the best route, it is discarded as it is most likely a copy. If it HAS taken the best route the router forwards the package. At this point Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcasting differ from each other: RPF: If the package has used the best route, the router resends the message to all edges, not including the one from which the message came from. RPB: If the package has used the best route, the router resends the message to those edges over which it would be the best route.",The response correctly answers the purpose and the explanation for both broadcast types. The purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast is not limited to multicasting but also used in broadcasting.,Correct,1.0,0

da227ca3b5de401da8f005ae0b9b4dc0,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","Hidden Terminals: Two nodes A and C try to communicate with a third node B, however A and C are not aware of the other station respectively because they are not within range of each other. Node B is within range of both though, therefore collisions happen and the data which is sent to B get corrupted. Exposed Terminals: There are four nodes A,B,C,D. If node C is within range of node B and B is sending data to A, C will notice that B is currently sending and will wait until B is finished before starting to send it's own data. However, if the destination of B's transmission (in this case A) is not within range of C, and C wants to send data to D, there actually is no risk of collisions and C would be free send. That fact that C will wait for B to finish results in unused bandwidth. ( [ A { B ) | C ] D } | (.) = A's range [ ] = B's range { } = C's range || = D's range",The response correctly explains the hidden and exposed terminal challenges.,Correct,1.0,0

8b8d921892ec4325a7b96a3e60cda9e5,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast are broadcast routing algorithms. The purpose of them is that sending a packet to all destinations simultaneously while making full use of bandwidth and do not waste resources. 1. Reverse Pah Forwarding When a broadcast packet arrives at a router, the router checks to see if the packet arrived on the line that is normally used for sending packets from source to destination. If so, the very broadcast packet used the best route until now and is therefore resend over all edges. If not, i.e. the packet did not use such route, it will be discarded like duplicate. 2. Reverse Path Broadcast When a packet arrives at the intermediate system, IS checks to see if the packet arrived at the entry port over which the packets for this souces S are usually sent. If so then it continues checking to see if the packet used the best route until now. If this nested-if holds true, then select the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are rerouted to source S. If it holds false, then do not send over all edges. Otherwise, the arrived packet will be discarded as a likely duplicate.","The stated purpose is incorrect as the response is not explicit about which resources and how their wastage is avoided. The explanation for RFB and RPB is correct except that in both algorithms, the packet is also not forwarded to the edge from which it was received.",Partially correct,0.7,0

A major disadvantage is that a framework is required to keep track of connections as well as transactions. 3) Identifying PDUs individually - By keeping track of individual packets, and assigning them a sequence number, duplicate packets can be identified and ignored.

This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals.

This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","Mobile devices change their location a lot.

18901be042784650929f602b7d0caf88,"Consider a single server queueing system with a buffer of size 10. Let us assume that 9 packets arrive per second and 10 packets are served per second on an average. Assume you monitor the system for exactly one minute after the system reaches equilibrium. How many seconds would you expect the system to be in a state in which there are less than 10 packets waiting in the queue? You need to justify your answer by showing steps involved; calculations, however, need not be included. headers.","Since we have a buffer size (N) of 10, we will always have less than 10 packets waiting in the queue unless there are exactly 10 packets in the queue. Therefore, we first calculate the probability of the system being full/having 10 packets in the queue. This is also called “blocking probability” or P_B. P_B = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^N) / 1 - utilization^(N+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508 Alternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate P(X less than 10) = (1 -P_B) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, …, 9 packets to be in the queue. To calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with P(X less than 10) or the complement of P_B (0.25p) = 60 * (1-P_B) = 56.9512 seconds","We have an arrival rate lambda = 9 packets per second, and a service rate mu = 10 packets per second. Therefore, our system utilization is ro = lambda/mu = 9/10. Since we start monitoring the system when it reaches equilibrium, we can use the balance equations to calculate the probabilities for each state. We take the equation for the probability p_n, that the system is in state n = 10, meaning there are 10 packets in the waiting queue, and with N = 10, meaning the buffer size of the waiting queue is 10. The equation for p_10 is therefore p_10 = ((1-ro)*ro^10) / (1-ro^11) = 0.0508 Now the probability of having less than 10 packets is (1 - p_10), since the normalization condition yields that the sum of all probabilities for the states equals 1, and we can have at most 10 packets in the waiting queue because of the buffer size 10.

Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)","A useful property for broad-/multicasting of the spanning tree for a certain node is that it does not only specify the optimal path from the other nodes to this node, but also the optimal paths from this node to the other nodes. Link State Routing can be used to construct multicast spanning trees by first running the Link State Routing procedure to get the spanning tree for a certain node X. This spanning tree could already be used as the multicast spanning tree for node X, but it can be optimized by removing all edges that are not part of any path between any two nodes of the multicast group.","What makes spanning trees desirable for multicast and broadcast is the absence of loops and, thus, minimizing unnecessary duplicates.

e2269e7f2bf247f6adc2fdec1830c60b,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","Hidden terminals: -nodes in wireless network may not be able to hear each other’s transmissions -for example, two nodes that are outside each other’s range performs simultaneous transmission to a node that is within the range of each of them resulting in a collision Exposed Terminals -a node is prevented from sending packets to other nodes because of co channel interference with a neighboring transmitter -for example, the node is within the range of a node that is transmitting and it cannot be transmitted to any node","The response states and describes the hidden terminal challenge correctly.

Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node.

The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.","This is a very strong assumption and not realistic since in reality you often have a period of time where you need a constant packet transmission, like for example in video streaming.

They enable improved flooding: it is checked whether a copy of a data unit has been received. If this is the case, no forwarding takes place to AVOID LOOPS. REVERSE PATH FORWARDING (also called Reverse Path Flooding) (RPF) is a variation of the method spanning tree. Each sender has its spanning tree. The other nodes don't have to know the spanning tree. The assumption is that each router knows which path it would use for packets. The RPF algorithm checks whether a packet arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station are usually also sent. If yes, then the algorithm assumes the packet went the best path until now and resends the packet to all edges but the incoming one. If not, it assumes that the packet is a duplicate and didn't use the best route. This duplicate is then not forwarded but discarded. The significant advantage of this algorithm is its simple implementation. If a node assumes that a packet will reach it first by the shortest route, all that needs to be done is to ensure that a receiver can detect duplicates. As soon as a duplicate is received, it is assumed that the shortest route did not receive the packet, and it is not forwarded. The disadvantage of this method is that some nodes receive the packet unnecessarily several times. The REVERSE PATH BROADCAST (RPB) is like RPF but with a specific selection of outgoing links. After the first check, the algorithm checks if the packet used the best route until then. If yes, it selects the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source S. If not, it won't send over all edges. Reverse Path Broadcast (RPB) is an improvement on RPF. RPB not only evaluates the shortest path concerning the interface on which the multicast packets are received but also influences the forwarding of the data to the interface of the router. As a result, the multicast packets are only forwarded to the interfaces at which the next router is in the opposite direction on the shortest path to the data source. To be able to decide about forwarding, the routers must be informed about the shortest paths.",The response correctly explains the purpose and concepts of RPF and RPB.,Correct,1.0,0

4a808169ee0c498c8ba00d0b97c58ad6,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","One challenge in mobile routing is the so-called hidden terminal problem. As nodes have an inherently limited transmission range, different nodes in the network may be located to far from each other to directly be able to communicate. However, there can be other nodes in the intersection range of these nodes that can send and receive to/ from both sides, increasing the risk of transmission collisions from the hidden nodes. Also, the limited transmission range itself poses a challenge fro mobile routing as the signal strength of a sending node decreases proportionally to the square of the distance. Therefor, stronger signals from nearer nodes can completely overwrite weaker signals from more distant nodes.","The response doesn't explicitly mention the Near and Far terminal problem, but it provides the correct description.",Correct,1.0,0

There is no acknowledgement of receiving data, as well as no flow control. Therefore, this kind of service does not need any kind of connect or disconnect phase. -Confirmed, connectionless Service: Each packet requires an acknowledgement signal sent form the receiver to the transmitter afterwards. If this signal is received at transmitter or if it comes too late (after a certain time frame), the same package is sent again to the receiver. Now, we have the possibility of duplicates and sequence errors due to retransmit. -Connection-Oriented service: To avoid all kind of loss- duplicate or sequencing-error , this service needs 3-phased communication to establish a state-oriented virtual “circuit switching”: At the beginning, we have a connection initialization, then a process of sending and acknowledging packages followed by a distinct disconnection process. All in all it can be summarized, that all three services are different in the amount of of care that is spent for error protection and signal acknowledgment.

b56fbf5ddfbf45caa0c764e2dc0d9dcc,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","The PURPOSE of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse path Broadcast is ensuring loop-free forwarding of multicast packets in multicast routing. In REVERSE PATH FORWARDING, each IS has its own spanning tree instead of a global unified spanning tree and does not need to know other spanning trees. Each IS has information which path it would use for (unicast)-packets. Now if a packet arrives at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent, this means: the packet used the BEST route until now and thus resend over all edges (not including the incoming one). If Not, this means the packet did NOT use this route (it is NOT the best route) and thus discard the packet as it is most likely a duplicate. THE PROBLEM WITH REVERSE PATH FORWARDING is that the packet is sent through all edges except for the sender. This is solved by REVERSE PATH BROADCAST. Here, each node learns from the unicast packets. Only If the IS is located on the unicast between the broadcast sender S and a neighbor node B, then it will forward the packet.","The response is partially correct as in RPF, the sender alone needs to be aware of the spanning tree, and an intermediate system only needs to be aware of which path it would use for (unicast)-packets (known through the unicast routing algorithms). The explanation of RPB is correct. The purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse path Broadcast is not limited to multicasting but also broadcasting.",Partially correct,0.8,0

Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","ENERGY EFFICIENCY IS ONE MAJOR PROBLEM IN MOBILE ROUTING COMPARED TO WIRED NETWORKS, BECAUSE DEVICES ARE NOT CONNECTED TO POWER SUPPLY ALL THE TIME.

RPF can work using uni-cast and multi-cast. When a broadcasted message arrives at a node, the node keeps track of where the message arrived from first, and ignores the messages that arrive later. Next, the node broadcasts the packet in all directions except the path it came from. This way, the shorted track between the source and node are tracked. RPB works by forwarding packets only on the best unicast path. The best path is known by keeping track of the path used to broadcast packets between nodes.","The RPF explanation is partially correct as it incorrectly states that the receiving node ignores the later messages. RPB's explanation is also partially correct as the best path is identified by keeping track of unicast and not broadcast messages. Also, the purpose of reducing duplicate packets in the network is missing in response.",Partially correct,0.4,0

This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals.

Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","Hidden Terminal: Two Nodes (A,C) that can not hear each other want to send to the same other node(B).

HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","The purpose of RPF and RPB is to reduce redundancy, when broadcasting packets, on connection lines, which are not useful to the broadcasting process and try to create a spanning tree (without loops). In Reverse Path Forwarding the sender broadcasts its packets to its neighbours with their source node noted. They will rebroadcast the packets to their neighbours, only not back to the sender, until the packets reached every node. Every receiving node has to ""ask itself the question"": Has this packet arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent? If the answer is YES, it will assume that the received packets used the BEST route until now and they are rebroadcasted on all edges. Otherwise the node will assume that the packets did not take the best route until now and they will be discarded. Reverse Path Broadcast is a more complex version of RPF. In this scheme the packets will also carry information about the taken route. Every time a node receives packets it will have to ""ask itself"" two questions. First ""has this packet arrived at the IS entry over which the packets for this source station are usually also sent? If the answer is NO, the packets will be discarded. Otherwise it will ""ask itself"" the next question. ""Have the packets used the BEST route until now?"" If the answer is YES the node will send the packets onto an edge.

Advantage :it is more efficient than carrier extension as single frames not filled up with garbage. Disadvantage :need frames waiting for transmission or buffering and delay of frames","To use CSMA-CD with a fast connection, the packet size needs to be increased, messages with a size of 512 byte are sent instead of 512 bit. ""Frame bursting"" is one feature to reach the desired larger packet-size. Using ""frame bursting"", smaller frames are concatenated to a sequence of frames. If this sequence is still not large enough, the hardware adds padding to reach 512 byte of size. ""Carrier extension"" fills the 512 bit messages with padding, until the message has the required size of 512 byte.

8db405e896be4e2a8e55af2bb84d54c2,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","Hidden Terminals: The problem is, that nodes outside of a specific radius cannot communicate with others. Two nodes can send to one node at the same time, collisions can occur. In wired networks, CSMA/CD would solve this. Near and far terminals: For a node that receives a strong signal from a near node, it is hard to hear another signal from a weaker node in a longer distance","The stated challenges description is partially complete.

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)","A Spanning Tree is a subset of subnets which includes all routers and contains no loops. As soon as every router knows which lines belong to the spanning tree, it can broadcast/multicast all packages on those lines except the one it arrived on. It is quite easy and makes efficient use of bandwidth since the IS generates only a minimum number of packet copies. In Link State Routing, all intermediate stations send link state packets periodically. They contain information about the distances to the neighbours. To construct a spanning tree, this information has to be expanded by the information on existing multicast groups.

HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","Reverse path forwarding ensures a loop-free forwarding for multicast packets in multicast routing moreover, it prevents IP address spoofing in a unicast routing.

778eb20c536c4e5faf53afd96b1ec3e3,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","1. Hidden Terminals: In mobile routing we communicate wireless. Consider the setup from slide 11: A to B, C to B. In here, node A can communicate with the intermediate node B but not with node C. Node C can communicate with the intermediate node B but not with node A. The hidden terminal problem occurs when node A and node B want to send data to node B at the same time. This results in collsions and waste of resources. The collision problem can be solved with Request-to-Send (RTS) and Clear-To-Send (CTS) mechanism. When node A wants to send something to node B, node A first asks whether the communication channel is available through RTS. If everything is ok, B sends a CTS message to A and C. As a consequence, node C knows that nothing can be sent to B for a certain amount of time. If node C wants to send something to B, C needs to reserve the channel too by a RTS. 2. Near and Far Terminals: - Consider the setup from slide 18: We have three nodes A, B and C. B and C are relatively close to each other while A has a larger physical distance to the other nodes. The problem of near and far terminals occurs when A and B want to send something to C at the same time. Due to the fact that the signal strength decreases the larger the distance is, the signal of B drowns out the weaker signal of A. As a consequence, C cannot receive anything from A.",The response correctly explains the hidden and near and far terminals challenges.,Correct,1.0,0

Finally each IS can calculate a multicast tree as well as the outgoing lines on which packets have to be transmitted.,"The explanation behind using a spanning tree for multicast and broadcast is partially correct because though the network is loop-free, using the tree results in the minimum number of message copies required to be forwarded and not just the prevention of forwarding loops.

4d806981ff4d4e279c414a7a929a89f0,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","The main challenges that occur with mobile routing are hidden, exposed, near and far terminals that need to be dealt with. This is due to the fact that we have to deal with user mobility and device portability that fixed and wired networks don’t have to deal with. Hidden Terminals: Two nodes A, B that cannot hear each other have overlapping radius in which a third node C is. If both A and B want to send to C, they don’t know about the other sender and we have to deal with collisions. Exposed Terminals: Two nodes A, B that can hear each other want to send to different nodes C, D that are outside the reach of either A or B. If A sends to its neighbour C, then B will wait before sending to D even though it is not necessary. This leads to an underutilization of the respective channels.",The response answers the hidden terminal challenge correctly but the description of the exposed terminal does not state why B will wait for A to send.,Partially correct,0.875,0
a2add958e92f4fbc8e3939ab37c5595d,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","Reverse Path Forwarding is a variation of the spanning tree. Each Sender has its won Spanning Tree. So if a node revives something from one of its links it checks the source adress( example :A) and compares with its own table, if it would send something to A: Wold I use the same link for that ? If that is the case the node knows that this is the optimal link for this direction. →Assumtion Package used the best rout until now→Resend to all edges beside the incoming one. If that is not the case →Assumtion this is not the optimal route →Discard the package because it is likely a unnecessary duplicate. Reverse Path Broadcasting is similar. But instead of sending it everywhere, after coming from the optimal rout, you send it only to the link that you would use to get to this destination. Assumtion for both systems is that everything is working correct and everyone knows the directions the need to send","The response does not state the purpose for both. The assumption behind them is that the packet used the BEST route

If the concatenated sequence of multiple packets has no error and all is good, the packets will be sent. +1 advantage : Better efficiency compared to 'carrier extension' because no additional ""rubbish"" data is added to the actual frame, but in frame bursting it is waited for real data packets to be added in a buffer. -1 disadvantage : The waiting time could cause delay, because f.e. a sender always has to wait till the buffer is full and till the data transmission/send could be started.","The response answers the advantage and disadvantage of frame bursting correctly.

Their purpose is to reduce network load in comparison to more rudimentary approaches for broadcast routing like flooding, by utilizing the information each IS can gain from looking at unicast routing paths and therefore only forward packets which are on the best route so far. In Reverse Path Forwarding, each sender maintains its own spanning tree derived from information gathered during normal unicast operation. If a unicast packet from A to C passes a router B frequently, B knows that it is on the shortest path from A to C and reverse. If, on the other hand, a router D never sees any unicast packets from A to C, or reverse, it knows, that it is not on a shortest path. This information is then used when a flooding packet from A or C (sender) arrives at either C or D (IS). Only if the IS is on the shortest path, it forwards the packet. Reverse Path Broadcasting is an improvement of Reverse Path Forwarding. Not only does it evaluate the shortest path according to the IS entry port, where it received the multicast packets like RPF does, but also influences how the packets are then forwarded to the outgoing edges. In contrast to RPF, which just sends the packet over all edges except the incoming one if the packet has arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station are usually sent, i.e. the best route, RPB attempts to send the packet only over suitable edges.

Does this assumption hold for real INTERNET traffic? Explain your answer in 2-5 sentences.","No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.","No, this assumption does not hold for real internet traffic since problems that may block the arrival of packets may usually persist longer than one time step Δt. If for example the arrival is blocked by congestion it is more likely to still have congestion in the next time step.

The reason is that the sending station interrupts the transmission as soon as it detects a collision. A collision can occur if 2 or more participants try to send data packets at the same time and interfere with each other. So CSMA CD is a good option, especially if they want to expend the amount of systems from 20 to a few more. This procedure also is used frequently and saves time and bandwidth.

4da4a527b1224accaf262ca2d1ecb2b7,"What is ""frame bursting""? Also, give 1 advantage and disadvantage compared to the carrier extension.","Frame bursting reduces the overhead for transmitting small frames by concatenating a sequence of multiple frames in one single transmission, without ever releasing control of the channel. Advantage :it is more efficient than carrier extension as single frames not filled up with garbage. Disadvantage :need frames waiting for transmission or buffering and delay of frames","Frame bursting is one of two features of shared broadcast mode in IEEE 802.3z. In this case we allow sender to put few data frames together and send them in a single transmission. Compared to the carrier extension, we get better efficiency (in carrier extension we use only ~10% of the frame length to send data), but on the other side we need to consider what if there is no enough frames to send the data. For example, we are able to send 10 frames together, but if we have only 8, sometimes is not very efficient to wait for another frames. In this case some mechanism has to be implemented (such as filling remaining space with rubbish data).","The response correctly answers all three parts of the question with an example. However, the answer also states the 9% efficiency of carrier extension which is only valid in worst case scenario. The efficiency can be better based on how much data we are sending which can vary between 46-1500 bytes.",Correct,1.0,0
f83781a2a0de4fc98d7ede67e5e2fe23,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","Purpose: duplicate avoidance and find the “best” route / shortest path with spanning trees, easy to implement Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF): Each sender knows the network as spanning tree for itself. Intermediate systems (IS) must not know the spanning trees. Once a packet arrived at a IS there are two possible ways to forward: (assuming shortest path transmission/”best route”) * Once a packet arrived from node A on the same link as node B expect packets by its routing table, then this packet will be forwarded to all other links except the incoming link. * Once a packet arrived from node A on another link as node B expect packets from A, then this packet will be discarded. Reverse Path Broadcast (RPB): Works like RPF but chooses specific links for the outgoing traffic. By forwarding unicast packets an IS e.g. M learns whether it is located on the shortest path between two other nodes (e.g. node S and D). If this is not the case and S is sending a broadcasting packet, M would not forward this packet towards D as it knows that it is not on the shortest path from S to D. If M has learned that it is on the shortest path, it will obviously forward a broadcast packet to the destination. Depending on whether a certain path is used for unicast packets, an IS will use it to forward broadcast packets or omits the packets. Thus, the overall network throughput is reduced.",The response correctly explains RPF and RPB and their purpose.,Correct,1.0,0

EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.,"Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)","Globally knowledge of multicast group's spanning tree is what makes it appealing for broad/multicasting. Link State Routing is modified to construct spanning tree for multicasting by: 1. All IS send link state periodically, and it contains the distance to neighbours, expanded by information of multicast groups 2. Each IS calculates a multicast tree, from the now locally available and complete state information 3. IS determines the outgoing lines and on which packets have to be transmitted based on the information of the multicast tree",The stated property of a spanning tree is incorrect.

Does this assumption hold for real INTERNET traffic? Explain your answer in 2-5 sentences.","No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node.

Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa.

f2ffba427a134276a72cf5d5a35b71fc,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",Challenges of Mobile Routing as compared to routing in fixed and wired networks: * Dynamic Topology: changes in topology are more common and frequent for mobile networks. And routing protocols in fixed and wired networks create routing tables independent of demand which can be very costly in Mobile Routing. * Power and Bandwidth: Mobile devices have limited battery and bandwidth available to them and hence routing algorithms need to be extremely efficient and use as little of both as possible. * Security: Mobile networks have a wider range of security threats than wired networks. Nodes can join the network if they are in range and attacks like DOS are easy to perform. There is no boundary between the inside network and the outside world. The unpredictable and dynamic topology means that no safe routes can be established and reused. For eg: Black hole attacks.

In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","Reverse Path Forwarding is used for loop free broadcasts of multicast packages, while reverse path broadcasting is an improved version of RPF. They work by assigning every Sender its own spanning tree, while the IS does not have to know them. If a Node gets a package from a link that it knows from its spanning tree is the best possible route to it, it resends it on every other port, if it gets a package on a port, that it knows is not the best route it discards it. RPB on the other hand improves this algorithm in a way that it looks at the package, if it always took the best route, not only if it arrived at the best port. This way far less packets get resend, which reduces the traffic on the network.","The purpose is not limited to multicast but also used in broadcast.

Does this assumption hold for real INTERNET traffic? Explain your answer in 2-5 sentences.","No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.","This assumption is not 100% applicable due to the fact, that there are packets which are dependent on each other like TCP packets.

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)","- Good property: Not all paths between the routes must be used. Therefore, the network topology will be simplified and loop formation can be prevented.

9f45dcf50258491fbde7fdd47eeb68cf,"To model the packet arrivals as a poisson process, we assumed that the arrivals for each time interval Δt are independent. Does this assumption hold for real INTERNET traffic? Explain your answer in 2-5 sentences.","No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.","The assumption of independent Poisson arrivals has been justified by claiming that the aggregation of many independent and identically distributed renewal processes tend to Poisson process when the number increases. Poisson processes are conventional in traffic application scenarios that include a large number of independent traffic streams. The theoretical background behind the usage comes from Palm's theorem (Arrowsmith et al. 2015). It states that under suitable but mild conditions, such a large number of multiplexed streams approach a Poisson process as the number of streams grows. Still, the individual rates decrease to keep the aggregate rate constant. But, traffic aggregation need not always result in a Poisson process. So it holds if the above-mentioned criteria apply.","The response does not provide an explicit ""yes"" or ""no"". It instead states another underlying condition when the Poisson process will hold, without concluding whether it holds for the real internet.",Incorrect,0.0,0

88d6d91b94a44b4a867cd450021d8ee6,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","Reverse Path Forwarding : It is for broadcasting, It is for fowarding and transmission packets in multicast routing without getting false IP addresses. It is a variation of the spanning tree, where every sender node has its own spanning tree and path. The intermediate systems in between don't need to know those. If the packets arrive at an IS, the packet used the best route available at that time. This is done by a resend over all edges, but not for the incoming one. If no packet arrived at the IS, the packet didn't use that route being not the best route. This is done by dismissing packets. Reverse Path Broadcast : It is for broadcasting. It is an improvement of Reverse Path Forwarding. It works like reverse path forwarding but with a specific selection of the outgoing links. The ""RPF"" has the disadvantage of resending over all edges. It would be better to forward packets over suitable edges. So if a packet arrived at the IS over which the packets for this station are usually sent before and the packet has used the best route until now, the suitable edges are selected at which the packets arrived. From those packets they are rerouted and resent to the source C. Otherwise the packets are not send over all edges. If no packet arrived, discard the packets.","The main purpose of RPF and RPB is to reduce redundant packets/duplicates in broadcast or multicast, IP address spoofing is also correct but that is not the primary purpose.The response correctly explains both RPF and RPB.",Partially correct,0.8,0

EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.,"Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)","Spanning tree creates a subset of all the subnets while including all the routers. Also there are no loops present in Spanning trees. In case of Link State Routing, all the IS sends packets containing distance to neighbours to all other nodes. After which the IS locally calculates a multicast tree through this information, the IS decides as to where to transmit the packets and which route should be taken.",The response correctly identifies the appealing property of a spanning tree for broadcast and multicast.

ae3e25a17b9f4be898acf6302c9615dd,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","The purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast is to avoid duplicate sending of messages which results in a congested network and to save the effort that emerges when already received messages have to be stored in memory. In Reverse Path Forwarding a node remembers on which path it has previously sent something to another node (assumption that this is the best path based on routing tables) and only accepts and forwards packets from that other node that are returning from that same path. An accepted packet is forwarded on every outgoing link except the one it came from. If packets are coming from other paths they are discarded based on the assumption that they are copies. Reverse Path Broadcasting makes use of the Reverse Path Forwarding principle except that the packets are not forwarded on every outgoing line but only on the ones which are part of a best path between two nodes. Every node is inspecting the flow of a network and can thus find out, whether they are on the best path between two nodes or not. If they are not on that best path they will not forward the packets to those nodes. By doing this the traffic in a network is restricted to less and less packets (fewer copies).",The response correctly explains the purpose and concepts of RPF and RPB.,Correct,1.0,0

Does this assumption hold for real INTERNET traffic? Explain your answer in 2-5 sentences.","No. Real internet traffic often comes in bursts. Therefore, arrivals are not independent because the probability of an arrival happening at a node is influenced by previous arrivals at the node. For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.",The assumption does not hold for real internet traffic because it has very strong assumptions: - It assumes that only one packet can arrive at the same time in the defined time interval. This is not realistic because there may be many time intervals then where 0 packets arrive and time intervals where more than one packet arrives in the same time interval e.g. depending on time of day - independence assumption does not hold because in different time intervals the probability that a packet (or packets) arrive will not always be the same like poisson process assumes - also the assumption that two or more packets arrive in one time interval is 0 is unrealistic.,"The response correctly states that the independence assumption does not hold.

For example, on-demand video streams selectively load the next video segments when needed. This means the actual network utilization depends on the current playback state on the client-side. The packet arrivals are not independent, as it is likely that there is a low utilization directly after the next segments have been loaded.","This assumption does not hold for real internet traffic. Time intervals are very small, while internet traffic (for example start watching a Youtube Video where the buffer is filled.) may have a long duration. Therefore the probability of packet arrival, in the timeslot directly after a timeslot with packet arrival is higher, than in the timeslot where its predecessor had no packet arrival.",The response is correct as it correctly associates the probability of a packet arrival happening at a node with previous arrivals at the node.,Correct,1.0,0

fe3ac4690bce4a86a5eaab3b166232d6,What are extension headers in IPv6 and where are they located in a packet? What is the main advantage of extension headers compared to IPv4?,"Extension headers are used to extend the fixed IPv6 header with additional, optional network layer information. If present, they are located between the fixed header/main header and payload/upper-layer header/ transport-layer header. Main advantage: One of the following advantages are considered fully correct: 1. It allows the appending of new options without changing the header. 2. IPv6 packets with optional headers are typically processed faster/simpler by intermediate devices as most of the options are ignored (except “Hop-by-Hop Extension”) while they are processed by all routers in IPv4 unless ordered otherwise.","Extension headers are additional headers for a packet that are not defined by the IPv6 standard. They are located within the data portion of the IPv6 packet. You can find them by following the offsets provided in the next header field of the IPv6 packet. The main advantage is, that the IPv6 header needs way less fields, and is better extendable in the future. If you want to modify the header with additional information, you can just add another header with your info and link it using the next header field.","The description of extension headers is incorrect as most are actually defined in the IPv6 standard. Additionally, extension headers are located between the main and next-layer header instead of in the data portion. IPv6 only saves one field by using extension headers because it doesn't need the option and IHL field but gains the next header field. The other advantage is correct.",Partially correct,0.25,0

You need to justify your answer by showing steps involved; calculations, however, need not be included. headers.","Since we have a buffer size (N) of 10, we will always have less than 10 packets waiting in the queue unless there are exactly 10 packets in the queue. Therefore, we first calculate the probability of the system being full/having 10 packets in the queue. This is also called “blocking probability” or P_B. P_B = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^N) / 1 - utilization^(N+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508 Alternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate P(X less than 10) = (1 -P_B) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, …, 9 packets to be in the queue. To calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with P(X less than 10) or the complement of P_B (0.25p) = 60 * (1-P_B) = 56.9512 seconds","N = 10 arrival rate = 9 packets/sec processing rate = 10 packets/sec u = arrival rate/processing rate = 9/10 = 0.9 The probability of being less 10 packets (P(less 10)) in the buffer is the probability of being 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 packets in the buffer. Since N=10 we consider a queue model with a finite buffer, so for this case Pn = ((1-u)(u^n))/(1-(u^(N+1))) So, P(less 10) = P0 + P1 + P2 + P3 + P4 + P5 + P6 + P7 + P8 + P9 = 0.94 So, since T=1min = 60sec 60sec * 0.94 = 56.4 sec Then, is expect that for 56.4 sec the system has less than 10 packets in the queue.","The response correctly explains how the number of expected seconds can be calculated.

Also, give 1 advantage and disadvantage compared to the carrier extension.","Frame bursting reduces the overhead for transmitting small frames by concatenating a sequence of multiple frames in one single transmission, without ever releasing control of the channel. Advantage :it is more efficient than carrier extension as single frames not filled up with garbage. Disadvantage :need frames waiting for transmission or buffering and delay of frames",Frame Bursting enables several short frames to be sent directly one after the other without carrier extension. This reduces the overhead caused by several individual frames and thus allows more efficient use of the network load. The disadvantage of this method is that devices with frame bursting can reserve more transmission time. Devices without frame bursting then get correspondingly less access to the data channel.,"The disadvantage given is correct for frame bursting in general.

3b7a058ad66f4c08ad1555a2227087b1,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","Hidden Terminals: When two nodes have a distance between them, so they can't reach each other, but send simultaneously data to a third node, its called Hidden Terminal. We have 3 Nodes A,B,C. A and C can't hear each other and the transmission by nodes A and C can collide at B, but A and C are hidden from each other. Near and Far Terminals: The signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance. So if we have 3 Nodes A,B,C. The stronger signal of B drowns out the weaker signal of A.

When cwnd >= ss_thresh, the congestion avoidance phase is entered. After a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. Then cwnd is reset to 1. Congestion Avoidance (cwnd >= ss_thresh):: In the congestion avoidance phase, cwnd is incremented more slowly. There are different incrementation strategies, but they usually grow linearly, e.g. only increment cwnd by 1 after all sent segments have been acknowledged. This is done until a packet is lost. Typically, this means that cwnd less than ss_thresh and the slow start phase is entered again. After a packet is lost / congestion the following adaption is made in both phases: ss_thresh = cwnd / 2. Then cwnd is reset to 1.",The first phase is called slow start and the second one is called congestion avoidance.

d8a4b5233d7d4b69b90e3e0ca16b3c3f,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","Two challenges are hidden terminals, which occurs when two nodes can communicate over the same AP but not directly to each other, and exposed terminals, which occurs when two devices want to transmit data at the same time, but encounter a channel interference.",The description of both the challenges is incomplete.,Partially correct,0.5,0

That saves time and bandwidth. Every Station can randomly send frames if the channel is free, their is no need for reservation or waiting for token or something else to send and this method is cheap, effective and well used in LANs. One potential weakness is that station has to realize during the sending of a frame if a collision is occurred.

ffeffdda4d5b400f927e1346a8cff08a,WHICH PROPERTY of spanning trees makes them appealing for broad- and multicasting? EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.,"Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)","A PROPERTY of a spanning tree, which make it appealing for broad-and multicasting is that it is a subset of subnets including all routers with NO LOOPS.

Finding the path with the lowest current utilization in terms of sent packets/bytes may choose the nearly full 1Gbit/s link because of a relatively low utilization although the 10Gbit/s link has more capacity.

1cc92c70aed741aba1acd0a0c10cde66,WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?,"Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting. Reverse Path Forwarding: Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now. Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).","Reverse Path Forwarding and Broadcast checks if the packets are send over the usual routes to prevent IP-Spoofing Every IS checks if the received packet arrived at the port over which the packets for this station/source are usually sent. If this is the case, the packet is resend over all edges. If this is not the case, the packet is discarded.","Though RPF and RPB can prevent IP-Spoofing, it is not their only use. As the name suggests, their main use is minimizing duplicates during broadcasting. The explanation of RPF is partially correct as the incoming edge is excluded from forwarding instead of resending. Additionally, no explanation for RPB is provided.",Partially correct,0.2,0

Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)","Spanning trees don't have loops, which might be a problem for routing algorithms, also only a minimal amount of copies are required.

96b668ff34df4722bb26784db70aac39,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","Hidden terminals: Two senders/receivers cant't see each other but a third station. Communications protocols may not work, collisions are likely. Signal Range \ interferation: There is a possbility that a stronger Signal drowns out another stations signal","In the hidden terminal problem's explanation, it is not clear who can hear whom and where, and why a collision occurs.

69c668843b924cf8a096b225d5f4c3c0,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.",1) Some nodes may be out of range of others. This is because each node only has a limited scope. 2) Mobile routing requires more flexibility. The environment can change rapidly and the routing mechanism has to adapt to that.,"While the second challenge of needing to be able to adapt to a dynamically changing environment is correct, the first challenge stated is not a challenge specific to mobile routing. In a wired network, nodes typically don’t have a direct connection to each other node as well.",Partially correct,0.5,0

These differ in their characteristics and areas of application. The first two services differ in whether or not the receiver acknowledges a packet when it receives it. The Unconfirmed Connectionless service does not include confirmation and assumes that the sent packets have arrived correctly. By confirming in the Confirmed Connectionless service, this service can ensure that all packets have arrived at the receiver. Lost packets cannot be confirmed and so the recipient sends the packet again after a specified timeout. Both mentioned services have no flow control and no explicit requests to establish or disconnect a connection. The Confirmed Connectionless service has an implicit confirmation if a connection can be established, exactly when its packets are confirmed by the receiver. The confirmation of the second service class can cause duplicates to appear at the receiver, when the confirmation of a packet does not arrive at the sender. The third service class executes a three-phase communication and tries to establish a connection first. If the connection is confirmed, packets are sent until a request for disconnection is sent and confirmed. If the communication takes place over an error-free channel, no losses, no duplicates and no sequence errors are to be expected. Flow control is guaranteed by the ""handshake"". The first service type is usually used for the transition of isolated single units in channels with very low error rate (e.g. LANs, voice communication).

For example, IPv4 ICMP packages have often been blocked because of their potential of carry malware.

8a16033473dc434fb5cb5c0e5d00d631,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","The first challenge: geographical problem: because of mobile devices, meaning devices can freely move from one geographical point to another simultaneously. Transmission range may dramatically vary because of devices’ free movement and the connection between any arbitrary nodes could no longer be available at different point in time in the future, although in the past, they are able to talk to each other. For this reason, mobile routing should take into account the geographical information to perform routing successfully in such scenario because the network is not fixed. The second challenge: unreliable wireless medium problem: because wireless network communication tends to be involved in mobile routing between mobile devices. The medium reliability could possibly greatly vary from urban environment to rural area. That introduces many problems such as medium access control, signal attenuation, collision avoidance, since listen-while-talk medium access control is not possible in wireless network. For this reason, some mobile routing protocol employs reactive routing strategy in its design, meaning routing path, routing information is not beforehand calculated when there is no need to do such routing, because the network cannot reliably assume that there will always be incoming messages to be forwarded according to the routing table which has been carefully calculated before because the network is not wired.",The response correctly states and describes the challenges faced in wireless network routing.,Correct,1.0,0

Which of the MAC procedures introduced in the lecture (Polling, TDMA with or without Reservation, Token Ring, Pure or Slotted ALOHA, 1-persistent CSMA, p-persistent CSMA, non-persistent CSMA or CSMA/CD) would you recommend?Give 2 reasons for your decision and 1 potential weakness of your recommendation in 2-6 sentences.","0.5 P for a sensible choice out of: Token Ring, p-persistent or non-persistent CSMA, CSMA/CD or TDMA with reservation 1P for the drawback and 1P for an advantage.The following properties may be considered: Scalability, waiting time, extendability, cost effectiveness, constraints, hardware requirements, compatibility, throughput, overhead, complexity and prioritization capabilities",I would recommend CSMA/CD. A reason is that because of the high channel load the channel needs a contention period so that everybody can use the channel and has the possibility to fight for a reservation slot. Another point is that it saves time and bandwith. There are less collisions because of the carrier sense and it's easy to expand. A weakness is that the station has to realize during the sending of a frame if a collision occurred.,"Why does by high channel load the channel need a contention period? Without contention, everybody gets the possibility to use the channel, too.",Partially correct,3.0,1
a1346183efba4307aaa20fc941ff5800,WHICH PROPERTY of spanning trees makes them appealing for broad- and multicasting? EXPLAIN how you can modify Link State Routing to construct a spanning tree for multicasting.,"Property: There is a single unique path between every pair of nodes in the tree. Alternatively, you can say that spanning trees are subnets of a network that do not contain loops but contain all nodes. This means that no unnecessary duplicates are distributed in the network when forwarding packets using that tree structure. Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: Each intermediate system knows which multicast groups it belongs to, but initially doesn’t know which other IS belong to the groups. Therefore, you can add multicast group information to the link state packet and each node can construct multicast trees once the full network topology and group information are distributed in the whole network, as each node then has the complete state information stored locally (e.g. with Prim or Kruskal)",PROPERTY: The spanning tree does not have any loops.,The response correctly answers why a spanning-tree usage is ideal in multicast and broadcast. The explanation for modifying the link-state algorithm to construct a  multicast spanning tree for nodes is not provided.,Partially correct,0.5,0

8b7a10600c0941998e018415ddd893c7,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","HIDDEN TERMINALS: Node A and Node C can not receive message from each other, and they send messages to Node B simultaneously. But the transmission can conllide at Node B and both messages are lost, then Node A and Node C are hidden from each other. EXPOSED TERMINALS: Node A, D are outside of range of each other and in the miiddle Node B, C are inside of the range of each other. B sends to A currently and C wants to send to D.

e9578284dbd044daaaec239e4dab1852,WHAT are the challenges of Mobile Routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? Please NAME and DESCRIBE two challenges.,"Possible Challenges: 1.Adaptation: The network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. Additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time. 2.Security: Interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. This may necessitate encryption and authentication. 3.Medium Access Control: Wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. See the following correct example challenges: i)Hidden Terminal: Nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (A and C in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. ii)Exposed Terminal: Nodes (C in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (B) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (B) is out of the detection range of the destination node (D) so that no collision would occur. iii)Near and Far Terminals: Signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away. 4.Quality of Service (QoS): Due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired QoS. Additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion. 5.Scalability: Since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. 6.Heterogeneity: Nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges 7.Dependability: Providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. 8.Power Consumption: As most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.","Mobile routing has problems over several layers. Examples are adaptation, security, QoS, scalability, heterogeneity, dependability/robustness. SECURITY: All packets used to insert the mobile computer into the network must be authenticated. This includes the integrity of the data and proof of its origin. SCALABILITY: Since the number of clients can change, more complex and scalable procedures are needed that can handle them.","The security challenge description is correct. In the scalability challenge, the difference between fixed and wired network routing is the dynamic and more frequent change in the client numbers.",Partially correct,0.75,0

Instead a 3 phased communication with connect and disconnect, and flow control","Unconfirmed connectionless service: Involves no flow control, no connect and no disconnect. Only isolated, independent units, so called frames, are transmitted. Confirmed connectionless service: Here, data may be retransmitted if an acknowledgement was not received which could lead to duplicates, sequence errors and loss of time and efficiency. Connection-oriented service: Involves flow control, connect and disconnect. In contrast to the other two service classes, losses, duplication and sequencing errors do not occur since the connection is realized over an error free channel.",The response answers the services' names and differences correctly.,Correct,1.0,0

Name the 2 phases of congestion control and explain how the Congestion Window (cwnd) and the Slow Start Threshold (ss_thresh) change in each phase (after initialization, where cwnd = 1 and ss_thresh = advertised window size) in 1-4 sentences total.","Slow start: ss_thresh is constant, increment cwnd by one every time a segment is acknowledged until ss_tresh is reached, then slowed increase of cwnd Congestion Avoidance: cwnd is reset to 1 after adjusting ss_tresh = cwnd / 2","The first phase of the TCP congestion control is the Slow Start with the goal to discover the proper sending rate. The sender starts by initializing cwnd to 1 which dictates the maximum segment size. The sender then send s the first segment and once the segment is acknowledged the cwnd is increased exponentially until the cwnd >= ss_thresh, then the increase of the cwnd becomes linear. Once a Timeout (=congestion) is detected, the second phase of congestion avoidance starts. Each time a timeout occurs, the ss_thresh is set to 50% of the current cwnd and the cwnd is reset to one.

947b6b8505504196b5e0ecdebc81f399,Transparent bridges manage a bridge table for the forwarding process. Please describe what information the table holds and how it is modified during the backwards learning phase. How is the table used in the forwarding process and what is one benefit of that? Please answer the question in 2-5 sentences.,"1.A mapping between destinations/stations (MACs) and outgoing LAN interfaces. 2.This table is initially empty and received packages are flooded on every line. When a bridge receives a frame (as the bridge runs in promiscuous mode it listens in on all the traffic arriving at its LAN links) with source address Q on LAN L, it adds the timestamped entry “Q can be reached over L” to the table and the next time a packet with destination Q arrives, it is forwarded on link L. The time-stamp is used to update or purge old entries. Therefore, it learns by observing the incoming traffic. 3.To do selective forwarding instead of flooding. 4.i)less duplication/unnecessary flooding is prevented. ii)less congestion. iii)better bandwidth usage than flooding.","At first the Bridge knows nothing about the network, so it uses flooding for all the unknown destinations. But with time the Bridge learns, from traffic, wich sources are in wich directions and where it needs to send packets to rech them. In regular intervals the Forwarding table gets refreshed to adapt to topology changes. Compares the frames from a source to the saved direction and updates it if it changes. (Timestamp of this frame is newer than my information ---> update the location). Bridge scans for machines with flooding if they were quiet some minutes.","The response correctly states the information contained in the bridge table.

Typically the network is often congested as all users generate more traffic than the link’s capacities. Which of the encoding techniques introduced in the lecture should be used in this network to encode bitstreams? Give two reasons for your answer in 2-4 sentences.,"Binary Encoding, as it is the most efficient in terms of bandwidth since you get a full bit per baud instead of only 0.5. Additionally, you do not have to deal with clock drift and various ticking rates as all clocks are perfect. Therefore, self-clocking / clock recovery is not as necessary. Simple and cheap is also acceptable as one of the reasons.","Binary encoding should be used. - As the users already have perfect clocks, we do not need any self-clocking feature. - The users are already generating more traffic than the link's capacities, so we should use the encoding that has the best utilization of the bandwidth, which is binary encoding (1bit per Baud)",Correct.,Correct,2.5,1
